Chief Complaint:
s/p pulseless arrest

Intubation
Arctic sun cooling/warming protocol

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3711**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU
following PEA arrest and resuscitation.  His wife reports that
on the day prior to admission he was in his usual state of
health without any complaints.  He went to bed at 11pm with his
CPAP on.  His wife awoke at 1:30AM and noted that he had a
strange breathing pattern.  She again awoke at 2:30 am and noted
that he continued to be breathing strangely and then made
several soft choking noises and stopped breathing.  She
attempted to awaken him with no response so she called EMS who
reportedly arrived withing 5-10minutes.
.
On EMS arrival he was noted to be in PEA arrest he was given 7mg
epinephrine, 2mg atropine, 2 amps sodium bicarb, 100mg
lidocaine, 300mg amiodarone, DCCV x 5.  He was started on
amiodarone gtt and dopamine gtt.  His pupils were noted to be
fixed and dilated by EMS.
.
On review of systems, his wife denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He does not have any
recent fevers, chills or rigors.  Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T34.8 rectal 128/77 HR 122 sinus
tachycardia RR 18 99% RA.  He had an EKG showing sinus
tachycardia and a bedside echocardiogram showing hyperdynamic LV
function, no wall motion abnormalities.  He was started on artic
sun protocol however his initial temperature was 34 degrees
celsius.  He had a head CT which showed evidence of global
anoxic insult.  He was admitted to the CCU for further care.

Past Medical History:

hypotension

Neurogenic bladder
- Has had foley catheter for 2 years due to urinary frequency
- Patient has not had Foley changed for 4 weeks
- h/o Klebsiella and Pseuodomonal UTIs in [**2710**], Enterobacter
urosepsis
Hypothyroidism

Hospital admission for partial small bowel obstruction and
constipation [**8-23**]

h/o idiopathic pancytopenia


Social History:
Patient lives in a house in [**Hospital1 532**], MA with his wife of 56 years
who is his main support and primary care provider. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] helps him
with all of his IADL's and ADL's, including dressing, showering
and medications. He has 5 children and 6 grandchildren. He used
to work in the construction business as a manager and has had
asbestos exposure in the past. He denies current smoking though
he does have a remote history of ~15 pack years of smoking. He
denies EtOH or drug use. He does not drive currently.

Family History:
Mother - DM, passed away at 84
Father - colon CA, passed away at 67

Physical Exam:
VS: T=34 celsius on artic sun BP=107/81 HR= 150 regular RR=18 O2
sat= 98%  AC 100%/550/16/5
Gen: intubated, unresponsive to any stimulus, no posturing noted
HEENT: NC AT, intubated pupils are fixed and dilated at 6mm
bilaterally, right pupil appears to be post surgical, left eye
with large cataract visible
Neck: right EJ 18G iv in place, no significant jvd
CV: RRR s1 s2 no appreciable murmur
Lungs: CTAB anteriorly, unable to ausculate lung bases as artic
sun cooling pads in place, no wheezing
Abd: distended, soft, unable to assess for tenderness given
mental status, positive bowel sounds
Ext: cool, palpable DP's bilaterally

Pertinent Results:
72 hour EEG: This is an abnormal video EEG study because of a
lack of discernible cortical activity. This study was not
performed under a brain death protocol, however. There were no
epileptiform features noted.
.
Head CT without contrast: Markedly limited study secondary to
streak artifact from metallic scalp leads. Hypodensities within
the bilateral basal ganglia and thalami in addition to
decreasing size of the lateral ventricles, which are barely
visible, all suggestive of increasing cerebral edema. A repeat
evaluation may be obtained once the metallic scalp leads have
been removed. These findings were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4853**] on
[**2711-9-25**] at 4:00 a.m.
.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above
interpretation.
However, in addition to diffuse hypodensity of the deep grey
matter
structures, there is strking hypodensity of essentially all
cortical grey
matter. This is so severe that the cortex is of lower density
than the white matter. This is associated with effacement of
cortical sulci. These findings indicate severe global cortical
edema. Given the history, this is most likely due to global
hypoperfusion and infarction.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o male with parkinsonism, autonomic instability, who was
admitted to CCU following PEA arrest, likely secondary to
aspiration, now s/p Arctic sun protocol, re-warmed and off
sedation, with anoxic brain injury and worsening cerebral edema
on CT scan, with flat lining EEG, no brainstem reflexes, and no
spontaneous breathing.
.
# s/p PEA arrest: unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology,
at this time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration
event given that main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also
with new bilateral infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial
effusion on echo, no evidence of pneumothorax.  No evidence of
acute MI on admission.  He did have a lactic acidosis, likely
[**3-20**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He was in sinus
tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I on
telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
In the CCU, pt went into PEA arrest again.  CPR was performed,
epi x 1 and atropine x 1 given, with cardiac function returning
within 3-5 minutes.  CT scan showed diffuse anoxic brain injury
with poor prognosis (flat EEG, CT head showing worsening
cerebral edema, physical exam without brainstem reflexes).  Pt
completed Arctic sun cooling, then warming protocol.  His
sedation was weaned when re-warmed.  Neuro evaluated the
patient, and noted absence of brainstem reflexes, fixed dilated
pupils, and no response to cold caloric testing.  Pt was made
DNR/DNI.  Amiodarone gtt was discontinued as PEA arrest felt to
be very unlikely to be primary cardiac.  Apnea test, combined
with neuro eval, confirmed brain death and patient was
pronounced dead at 4:23 pm on [**2711-9-27**].  Family at bedside,
declined autopsy.  [**Location (un) **] Organ bank felt that pt is not a
candidate for organ donation.
.
#Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, with significant
AA gradient.  Unclear etiology at this time, possibly [**3-20**]
aspiration event given LLL opacity and air bronchograms on CXR.
Pulmonary embolus was a consideration; however no evidence of
right heart strain on echocardiogram or PE on CTA.  Initially
started on vancomycin and zosyn for aspiration pneumonia, but
discontinued when family transitioned patient to CMO status.
.
#Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of
global anoxic injury likely [**3-20**] prolonged PEA arrest of unknown
duration.  Pt completed cooling protocol, then rewarmed, with
unchanged exam.  He was taken off fentanyl/versed with no
brainstem reflexes and poor prognosis, as per neuro.  72 hour
EEG showed no waveform.
.
# Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and
severe orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at
baseline as well as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual
for him to have blood pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then
up to the 160's in the evening.  Anoxic injury likely
contributing to labile BP.
.
# Dispo: patient declared brain dead at 4:23 pm on [**2711-9-27**].
Extubated soon thereafter.  Family at bedside, declined autopsy.
 Patient did not qualify for organ donation.
