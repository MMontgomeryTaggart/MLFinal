HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 75-year-old woman was
admitted to the CCU for decompensated heart failure.  She has
a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, and coronary artery disease.  She had a myocardial
infarction in [**2501-1-13**] and received a catheterization
with stent placement to the LAD that re-stenosed.  In [**2501-3-13**], she had an ICD placed for nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.  She had a repeat catheterization in [**2502-8-13**] revealing 70% lesions in LAD and first diagonal as
well as a totally occluded proximal right coronary artery.
She underwent three vessel bypass on [**2503-9-4**] (LIMA
to LAD, SVG to first diagonal, SVG to PDA) with a
bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement for severe mitral
regurgitation. She was discharged from [**Hospital1 68**] on [**2502-9-15**].

Of note, she was discharged off of levothyroxine which she
had been prescribed for hypothyroidism.  An echocardiogram on
[**2502-9-12**] revealed an LVEF of [**10-1**]%, dilated left
ventricle, 1+ aortic regurgitation, and 4+ tricuspid
regurgitation.

The patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**2502-10-6**] after three days of progressive dyspnea.  Her
laboratories were notable for an INR of greater than 5.8 and
a TSH of 42.  The patient developed respiratory distress and
was intubated on [**2502-10-8**].  The same day, the patient
reportedly had an episode of ventricular tachycardia with
rate in the 140s to 150s, systolic blood pressure in the 50s
to 60s.  She was started on Amiodarone, Vasopressin, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 68**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with history of MI, LAD stent and
re-stenosis, CABG with bioprosthetic mitral valve
replacement, congestive heart failure with LVEF of [**10-1**]%, 4+
TR, 1+ AR, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response, ICD placement for nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.
2.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine 1.3 to
1.9.
5.  Anemia.
6. Peptic ulcer disease.
7.  Hypothyroidism.
8.  Peripheral arterial disease.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Amiodarone 0.5 mg per hour.
2.  Vasopressin drip.
3.  Nisiritide drip.
4.  Levothyroxine 0.075 mg IV q.a.m.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive for smoking.  The patient lives
with her husband.

LABORATORY DATA AT [**Hospital3 **] ON [**2502-10-9**]:  Sodium 134,
potassium 3.8, chloride 95, total C02 28, BUN 77, creatinine
2.6, glucose 169.  CK 158, 126, 125, 141.  TSH 41.6, free T4
6.7.  ABG with pH 7.53, PC02 31, P02 76.  INR greater than
5.8.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.0, heart rate 71, blood pressure 105/48, weight 75.6
kilograms.  Ventilator settings with assist controlled with
500 cc:  Tidal volume respiratory rate 18, FI02 50%, and
oxygen saturation 97%.  General: The patient was intubated,
responsive to voice, and in no acute distress, pale.  HEENT:
Pupils 3 mm in diameter, light reactive.  Oral mucosa was
moist.  Extraocular motility intact.  Neck:  Supple, no
carotid bruits, JVP difficult to asses.  Lungs:  Scattered
crackles bilaterally.  Heart:  Soft heart sounds, regular
rate and rhythm, with normal S1, S2, positive S3.  Abdomen:
Obese, soft, nondistended, normal sounds.  Extremities:
Cool, 1+ pitting lower extremity edema.  Neurologic:  Cranial
nerves II through VIII intact, IX through XII not assessed.
The patient moves four extremities spontaneously.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  A.  Pump:  The patient
was admitted with known systolic dysfunction and
decompensated heart failure with multiple possible
contributing factors including uncontrolled hypothyroidism,
Rosiglitazone use, and dietary indiscretion.  She was taken
off of Vasopressin and started on dopamine for its inotropic
effects and blood pressure support.  She was placed on
Carvedilol 6.25 mg b.i.d. and diuresed with a furosemide drip
so as to lower her preload.  She diuresed well in response to
the furosemide and was extubated on [**2502-10-14**] without
event.  At this time, the dopamine drip was also taken off
and the patient maintained mean arterial pressures over 60
mmHg off of dopamine.  The furosemide drip was weaned off and
furosemide was started at a dose of 80 mg p.o. q.d.

On [**2502-10-17**], low-dose Captopril (6.25 mg) was
initiated for afterload reduction.  The furosemide was
titrated to a dose of 160 mg p.o. q.d. and spironolactone was
initiated on [**2502-10-19**].

On [**2502-10-20**], the patient received a Heart Failure
Service consultation.  They recommended holding the beta
blocker while the patient was fluid overloaded and
re-initiating it once she is in compensated heart failure.
The patient was seen by a nurse practitioner for heart
failure teaching and arranged for follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for further management of her heart failure as an
outpatient.

Prior to discharge, the patient's furosemide was decreased to
80 mg p.o. q.d. and her ACE inhibitor was changed to
lisinopril at a dose of 2.5 mg q.d.

B.  Rhythm:  As aforementioned, the patient had a reported
episode of ventricular tachycardia while at [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital.  On transfer here, she was taken off of intravenous
Amiodarone and placed on oral Amiodarone at a dose of 200 mg
p.o. t.i.d.  She received an interrogation of her ICD on
[**2502-10-10**].  She was placed on heparin for
anticoagulation in the setting of her paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and diffuse akinesis.  Her rhythm remained
A-sensed, V paced throughout admission.  She completed an
Amiodarone load for her ventricular tachycardia totaling 6
grams prior to conversion to a dose of 200 mg q.d.

2.  PULMONARY:  On admission, the patient was noted to have
significant pulmonary edema as well as bilateral pleural
effusions, left-sided greater than right-sided.  Despite her
aggressive diuresis, she had a persistent large left pleural
effusion.  After she was extubated, the CT Surgery Service
was consulted to place a chest tube and this was done
successfully.

The cytology of the pleural fluid was negative for malignant
cells.  Fluid contained blood, lymphocytes, and neutrophils,
and was exudative on the basis of Light's criteria.

After the placement of the chest tube with drainage of
pleural fluid, it was noted that the patient had an elevated
left hemidiaphragm likely secondary to postsurgical
diaphragmatic paralysis.

On [**2502-10-18**], the chest tube was discontinued.  On
[**2502-10-20**], she received chest fluoroscopy which
revealed that her left hemidiaphragm was indeed paralyzed.
However, by this point in her hospitalization, the patient
was breathing much better with oxygen saturations over 95% on
room air.

3.  RENAL:  The patient was noted to have a creatinine of 2.6
on admission as compared with her baseline creatinine of 1.3
to 1.9.  The differential diagnosis for the increase in GFR
was felt to include prerenal insufficiency from decreased
effective intravascular volume as well as ATN from
hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.  She did not have
casts in her urine sediment.  With successful diuresis and
inotropic support, the patient's renal function improved,
with creatinine downtrending consistently until it reached a
level of 1.6 on [**2502-10-22**].

4.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient's endocrine issues at the time of
admission included severe hypothyroidism by TSH at the
outside hospital as well as type 2 diabetes mellitus.  She
was placed on oral levothyroxine for the hypothyroidism and a
regular insulin sliding scale for her type 2 diabetes.  The
Endocrine Service was consulted for evaluation and management
of her hypothyroidism and they recommended continuing
levothyroxine at 175 micrograms p.o. q.d. and checking a free
T4 and TSH level in six weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Decompensated heart failure.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
5.  Left diaphragm paralysis with pleural effusion.
