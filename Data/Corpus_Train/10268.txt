HOSPITAL COURSE:  Assessment and plan was a 59 year old
female, status post myocardial infarction, late [**Month (only) 732**]
outpatient cardiac catheterization showed three vessel
disease, preserved ejection fraction.  The patient will need
neurology consult, carotid ultrasound prior to surgery.  The
patient had a neurology consult, please see Neurology note
for recommendations.  The patient had a carotid ultrasound on
hospital day #2 which showed no significant stenosis on right
or left carotid artery.

On [**2680-3-15**], the patient was brought to the Operating

intubated and had chest tube and wires placed.  On
postoperative day #1, the patient was extubated.  The patient
was continued on insulin drip, was weaned from Propofol and
Levophed.  The patient was afebrile with temperature maximum
of 99.5.  The patient was ventricularly paced with a pulse
rate of 89, blood pressure 109/54.  The patient was sating
89% on 4 liters of nasal cannula.  The patient's chest tubes
were removed.  Swan catheter was removed and the patient was
out of bed.  On postoperative day #2, the patient was
