Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2512**]
Chief Complaint:
Dehydration, anion gap metabolic acidosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 y.o. male with past medical history of coronary
artery disease s/p CABG, pacemaker placement, ? of cirrhosis,
and EtOH abuse who presented on [**2583-5-20**] with four or five days
of nausea/vomiting, malaise, and poor PO intake.  He denied any
bloody emesis, hematochezia/melena, or diarrhea and was still
passing normal bowel movements and flatus.  He reported that his
nausea wasn't constant but seemed to be increasing in frequency
and severity over the days just prior to presentation.  He
reports abdominal pain was a minimal portion of this syndrome.
He reported some occasional right sided, non-radiating,
non-exertional chest pain that had been going on about a month.


In the ED, VS:T98.3 HR94 BP120/96 RR 20 98%RA. Given  his
history of alcohol abuse he received thiamine, folate, K, and
NS, as well as D50 followed by NS, prochlorperazine, and
ondansetron for nausea.  He continued to have non-bloody and
non-bilious but profuse emesis despite antiemetics.  He
continued to vomit profusely while in the ED. Labs revealed an
elevated lactate at 2.9 and an anion gap metabolic acidosis with
HCO3 of 10.  VBG with pH of 7.19, HCT 32, Tn 0.03. He was
transferred to medicine for further management.  On arrival to
the floor the patient was more comfortable and vomiting less,
however, ABG showed a pH of  7.15.  Given concern about the
possible dangers of this acidemia and presumed need for closer
cardiac monitoring he was transferred to the MICU.

MICROBIOLOGY
============
Stool Culture [**2583-5-23**]:
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2583-5-24**]):
               FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.

OTHER STUDIES
================
Right Upper Quadrant U/S [**2583-5-21**]:
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited evaluation. Liver appears
echogenic, a finding which can be seen in fatty infiltration.
More advanced forms of liver disease, such as cirrhosis or
fibrosis cannot be completely excluded.  Gallbladder is
contracted and filled with stones.

Chest Radiograph [**2583-5-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
New patchy opacity at right base of uncertain significance -- ?
new
atelectasis versus early infiltrate versus differences in
appearance due to
change in positioning. If clinically indicated, a lateral view
may help to
further assess this finding.

ECG [**2583-5-20**]:  Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality and
occasional ventricular ectopy.  Right bundle-branch block. Left
anterior fascicular block. Probable prior inferior myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2581-12-3**]
ventricular ectopy has appeared. Otherwise, no diagnostic
interim change.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 75 year old male with past medical history of coronary
artery disease status post CABG, EtOH abuse, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and pacemaker placement who presented with
probable viral gastroenteritis causing nausea, vomiting, and
dehydration with hospital course complicated by C difficile
colitis and pneumonia.

1) Anion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient presented with an
anion gap metabolic acidosis in the context of poor PO intake
and significant vomiting.  Given elevated lactic acid and
improvement with IVF this was presumed due to dehydration in the
patient's GI complaints and poor PO intake.  This had resolved
by transfer to the floor and did not recur.

2) Nausea/Vomiting: Given lack of any localizing signs of acute
bacterial infection and lack of abdominal pain or other symptoms
as well as lack of diarrhea on presentation this was thought
most likely to be consistent with a rather severe case of viral
gastroenteritis with dehydration exacerbated by the patient's
generally poor self care and deconditioning.  As he had some
right sided abdominal pain at presentation he also had an
ultrasound of this area, which showed no choleycystitis.  The
patient's symptoms improved with anti-emetics and he had less
vomiting but he remained somewhat reluctant to eat out of fear
of nausea.  He then developed C difficile colitis with frank
diarrhea and had some worsening of his baseline nausea on PO
metronidazole therapy.  Prior to discharge (on [**2583-5-27**]) he was
switched to PO vancomycin given his persistent severe diarrhea
and the patient's ICU stay suggesting he met criteria for severe
disease and thus vancomycin might be the preferred [**Doctor Last Name 176**].

3) Dehydration: The patient was considerably dehydrated at
presentation, presumably due to his vomiting nausea causing
extremely poor PO intake in the context of baseline poor
nutrition and poor self care.  This improved with IV fluids as
well as the patient's general symptoms.  Given the patient's
continued poor PO intake and nausea he continued to require IV
fluid through the time of discharge to prevent dehydration and
hypotension.

4) Acute Kidney Injury: His creatinine was elevated at 1.3 at
presentation but had fallen back to 1.1-1.2, which is within
this patient's normal range, by time of transfer back to the
floor.  This was thought to be consistent with prerenal injury
secondary to dehydration/hypovolemia.

5) Hypoglycemia: Initial blood glucose of 40 at presentation.
This was thought likely secondary to poor PO intake and alcohol
use.  This resolved with dextrose and never recurred.

6) Clostridium Difficile Colitis: The patient did not have
diarrhea or abdominal pain at presentation and had no history of
antibiotic treatment.  Therefore, there were no major risk
factors for C. difficile colitis and this was not checked.  When
he developed diarrhea on [**2583-5-23**], however, the decision was made
to check for C difficile colitis as he was post-ICU stay.  He
remained afebrile and without abdominal pain.  When this assay
returned positive he was started on metronidazole on [**2583-5-24**].  He
was switched to PO vancomycin on [**2583-5-27**] given persistent nausea
and concern this could be associated with metronidazole.  He
will need to take this medication for at least seven days after
discontinuation of levofloxacin for pneumonia.

7) Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma and had
persistent issues with wheezing though he was never hypoxic on
room air.  This was responsive to bronchodilators.  He may
ultimately need combined inhaled corticosteroid therapy or more
aggressive regimen in the long term but this was not initiated
during his acute illness and in the context of possible
pneumonia.

6) Delirium: The patient developed delirium on [**2583-5-23**] in the
context of recent transfer to the floor and dehydration.  He
went from alert and oriented *3 to alert and oriented *1.  He
had a history of delirium and is probably predisposed to this
due to chronic EtOH toxicity on the brain and age.  Dehydration
and a possible pneumonia may have also contributed to his
general appearance of toxic-metabolic delirium.  This resolved
after approximately two days and he remained at baseline mental
status.

7) Pneumonia: The patient's chest radiograph was benign at
presentation but as of [**2583-5-24**] had developed a questionable
infiltrate.  He remained afebrile at that time and really had no
cough or other typical symptoms of pneumonia, but given his
delirium this was treated as there was concern an infection
could be contributing to his delirium.  Possibly, the patient
had a pneumonia at presentation and this simply became more
visible on chest radiograph after hydration.  He will need a
total of ten days of levofloxacin therapy.  This was initially
PO but switched to IV prior to discharge given the patient's
poor PO intake and concern of malabsorption.

8) ETOH: ETOH level was 53 on presentation and the patient
continued to report last drink on the evening of [**5-19**].  He has
no history of complicated withdrawal and never showed clear
signs of alcohol withdrawal.  The patient's CIWA scale was
discontinued on [**2583-5-23**] as he had been having minimal scores on
CIWA.  The patient was seen by social work to discuss his
alcohol use.

9) Decubitus ulcer: The patient was incidentally noted to have a
decubitus ulcer on presentation to the CCU.  This was presumably
due to his minimal mobility at home and presumably somewhat to
his poor nutrition.  There was never considerable erythema
around this or frank purulence.  Good wound care was instituted
and nutrition consult offered supplement suggestions that were
implemented to help healing.

10) General Deconditioning: The patient was noted to be very
weak and on examination by the PT service and was considered
unsafe to return home unsupervised.  Acute rehab was recommended
and the patient was initially reluctant to go to rehab but then
agreed to go.

11) Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: This is chronic and he has
previously undergone bone marrow biopsy, which showed
hypocellularity but no strict dyserythropoesis.  This is most
likely due to chronic myelosuppresion due to his alcohol use.
His anemia and thrombocytopenia remained stable throughout his
hospitalization.  Haptoglobin was normal and no schistocytes on
smear.

Prior to discharge the patient was tolerating very little PO but
was intermittently consuming a low residue diet without event.
He received SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  He was continued on
his home H2 blocker for GI ppx.  He was full code.  His HCP was
his separated wife, Mrs [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1121**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5597**] or
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 5598**].

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital **] Rehab

Discharge Diagnosis:
Probable viral gastroenteritis
Dehydration
Pneumonia
Clostridium Difficile Colitis
Stage 4 decubitus ulcer


Discharge Condition:
With wheezes on auscultation bilaterally, 93-95% at rest on room
air, very weak and requiring help with turning or ambulation


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted because you had what was probably a viral
infection of your digestive tract that caused your vomiting and
nausea.  This led you to have problems eating and get
dehydrated.  We gave you IV fluids, which helped you feel
better.  While in the hospital, we also discovered you had an
infection of your lungs for which we gave you antibiotics.  You
also had an infection of your colon for which you received
antibiotics.  Finally, we were concerned about how weak you were
in the hospital so you were discharged to a rehabilitation
facility to work on your strength and help care for your ulcer.

Your medications have been changed.  You have been started on
LEVOFLOXACIN and METRONIDAZOLE to treat pneumonia and C.
difficile colitis respectively.  Please take all your
medications as presecribed.

Please return to your local ED or call your doctor if you have
chest pain, shortness of breath, inability to tolerate food by
mouth, or any other concerning changes in your health.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5591**] about 1-2 weeks after being
discharged from rehab.  Office number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5595**].
