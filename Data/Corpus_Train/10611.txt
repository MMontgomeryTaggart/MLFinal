Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6681**]
Chief Complaint:
penile pain, lower extremity weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of central line in RIJ vein

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 y.o. male with PMH significant for ischemic CM (EF
45%), OSA on CPAP, DM who presents with chief complaint of
bilateral leg weakness, cough, DOE, and low urine output after
surgery. He is currently POD#3 s/p penile pump implant
([**Date range (1) 6685**]/05 ) during which time the glans was persistently
dusky in color. On POD #2 his foley cath was removed, but he
failed to have significant urine output. Post void residual was
250 cc of urine, and he was discharged with a foley in place.
His wife notes that he had less that 200 cc of urine during the
day he was at home. Today he noticed that his legs were weak and
he had pain in his penis, so he decided to go the ED instead of
his scheduled follow up visit.
.
In the ED he was found to be hypotensive to 81/41 with
temperature of 99.3. He received 500 mg of levoquin IV and a
code sepsis was called. A central line was inserted and he
received 3 liters of normal saline without apprecible urine
output. Levophedrine was started for persistently low pressures.
He was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED the pt was given 3000ml of fluids. He was continued on
Levoquine 500mg iv initially. Levophed was started to maintain
adequate blood pressure. He was transferred to the ICU where he
received a total of 2750cc of fluid in form of boluses. He was
found to be in acute on chronic renal failure with a creatinine
of 4.6. A central line and arterial line was placed. Levophed
was continued. Levaquine was stopped and the pt was started on
Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. Urology was consulted. The acute
event was not thought to be in relation to the operative
procedure three days prior. The swelling and pain the pt
experienced in his penis and scrotum was consistent with normal
postoperative changes.
The pt was found to have elevated troponins (0.29). He never
complained of chest pain. EKGs showed T wave changes but no ST
segment changes. Echo showed no evidence of RV dysfunction c/w
PE, no change in mild TR; overall function similar to old EF
showing EF 45%. Recent stress test without evidence of ischemia.
The etiology was thought to be demand ischemia in the setting of
hypotension. The BNP was elevated to [**Numeric Identifier 3622**] although there were
no signs of Lsided heartfailure on CXR and overt signs of R
sided failure on exam. The LE edema was at baseline for the pt.
Bilateral LE US was negative for DVT. Losartan was hold during
the hsopital course adn was substituted by hydralazine and imdur
to achieve afterload reduction. Losartan should be restarted
once acute renal failure is resolved. toprol was switched to
metoprolol for better ability to titrate. The pt was given
metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 12**].
The pt was found to be adrenally deficient and was started on
Hyrdocortisone and Fludrocortisone. The pt responded well to IVF
and Levophed was discontinued. The pt remained normotensive and
was restarted on metoprolol for blood pressure and heart rate
control. He was transferred to the floor for further management.

Vancomycin was stopped after three days per ID recommendations.
Ceftriaxone was continued until the day prior to discharge when
it was changed to oral Cefpodixime which should be continued for
seven days suspecting a complicated urinary tract infection as
the urine analysis was suggesting. Urine and Blood cultures
remained negative. Fludrocortisone and Hydrocortisone were
discontinued. The pt remained normotensive and afebrile. The
central line was removed. Outpatient furosemide dose was
restarted at 60mg QD on day 4 of admission. A set of urine lytes
was checked and was most consistent with prerenal azotemia. The
pt creatinine continued to trend down to 2.1 on the day of
discharge. A voiding trial was done on the day of discharge. The
pt was not able to void most likely due to obstruction. The pt
was send home with a catheter in place to follow up with
urology.
The pt's diabetes mellitus was controlled with Lantus and SSC as
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 124**] Diabetes center sliding scale. The pt's hematocrit
was reduced from baseline which was attributed to dilution. The
pt has a chronic anemia chronic disease. BIPAP at night was
continued on outpatient settings ([**10-17**]). Lexapro was continued
for depression.
