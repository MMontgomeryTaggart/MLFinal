HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
male who fell down a flight of about approximately 10 stairs.

by EMS and had a head CT on arrival that was positive for
right subdural hematoma with minimal mass effect.  He did
have significant facial trauma with severe epistaxis and
multiple facial fractures.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital **] hospital course was
complicated by prolonged Intensive Care Unit stay, rapid
atrial fibrillation and acute renal failure.  A PEG and trach

service, renal service, as well as the cardiology service.
The patient's atrial fibrillation was eventually rate
controlled with Diltiazem.  His renal function range during
his hospital course rose from a low of 2.1 to a high of about
3.4.  His hospital course was further complicated by
respiratory failure and inability to wean from the vent.  The
patient did tolerate trach collar for a short course,
however, secondary to left lower lobe collapse and decreasing
two sets required to be put back on CPAP.  The patient was
also noted throughout the course of his admission to have
guaiac positive stools.  He was also seen by gastrointestinal
who declined any intervention at this time.  He is on
Protonix 40 mg per G-tube q.d.
