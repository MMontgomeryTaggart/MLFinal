HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old female who
had a mechanical fall.  The [**Known patient firstname **] fell down several cement
and concrete stairs head over heels.  She landed at the
bottom of the stairs supine.  This occurred at the [**Known patient firstname **]
dentist's office.  A doctor on the scene responded within one
was found down in a large pool of blood from her head, mostly
the blood was coming from her left ear.  She was apneic and
the doctor gave several mouth to mouth rescue breaths.  The
[**Known patient firstname **] reportedly regained spontaneous respirations.  Heart
rate was in the 90s and she had a full radial pulse.  EMS
arrived on the scene.  They attempted intubation without
success.  The [**Known patient firstname **] was subsequently brought to the [**Location (un) **]
intubated.  Lateral C spine films there reportedly showed a
C6 fracture.  [**Known patient firstname 253**] was then transferred to [**Hospital6 1900**] for further care.  She was
transferred on dopamine for blood pressure control and upon
arrival was already intubated.  She was not paralyzed or sedated
but she was completely unresponsive.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Myopathy with gait abnormality and
hysterectomy in [**2976**].

MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The [**Known patient firstname **] had a heart rate of 95.
She had initially no blood pressure, but then 63/32 was
recorded.  Heart rate 106, saturation was 100% intubated and
bagged.  Neurologically, GCS was 3T.  Pupils were fixed and
dilated at 6 mm bilaterally.  The [**Known patient firstname **] was unresponsive.
There was no corneal reflex.  There was no gag reflex.  There
was no spontaneous movement of the extremities.  There are
bilateral ecchymoses around the eyes with swelling.  There
was perfuse bleeding from the left ear and right naris of the
nose.  The endotracheal tube and oral gastric tube appeared
in place.  Her face was stable.  Neck was C spine
immobilized.  Chest was without bony abnormalities and
without deformity.  Lungs were with equal air movement
bilaterally.  Heart was tachycardic with a normal S1, S2
without murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nondistended without
bases.  There was decreased rectal tone.  The [**Known patient firstname **] was
guaiac negative.  Her back was with a left flank hematoma and
no spine deformity or step-off.  Pelvis was stable.
Extremities were cool.  There are palpable femoral pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Showed a white blood cell count of 24.1,
hematocrit of 20, down from 33.6 at the outside hospital,
platelets 51,000.  PT 100, INR greater than 65, PTT 150.
Sodium 141, potassium 3.3, chloride 113, CO2 15, BUN 23,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 198.  Urinalysis showed a specific
gravity of 1.005, greater than 50 red blood cells and nitrate
positive.  Lactate was 6.6.  Serum toxicology screen was
negative.  Arterial blood gases showed a pH of 7.22, pCO2 34,
pO2 356.  CT of the head was obtained which showed large
comminuted fracture involving the entire skull and face with
evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage extending into all
sinuses.  There was also extensive pneumocephalus.  CT of the
cervical spine showed multiple fractures involving the base
of the skull.  There was a question of a superior facet
fracture of C5.  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed
hemorrhagic fluid around the superior portion of the ET tube.
A mediastinal low attenuation density suggestive of blood.  A
wedge shaped right mid pole probable renal infarct.  A
moderate amount of free abdominal fluid and small
intraperitoneal air.  There was also extravasation of
contrast into the soft tissues posterior to the lumbosacral
region, bowel wall thickening enhancement and a flattened IVC
consistent with volume depletion and shock.  A fast exam done
by ultrasound was negative.  There was no pericardial
effusion, no fluid into the Morison's pouch.  A diagnostic
peritoneal lavage was also performed which showed no frank
blood.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  An arterial line was placed and a femoral
cordis line was placed.  Posterior nasal packing was
undertaken.  The [**Known patient firstname **] was then transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  Between her stay in the Emergency
Department and Surgical Intensive Care Unit, the [**Known patient firstname **]
received 10 units of packed red blood cells, 10 liters of
isotonic intravenous fluid, 4 units of FFP, 6 units of
platelets and 2 units of cryoprecipitate. The [**Known patient firstname **] blood
pressure was remained around the 70s to 90s systolic with
Neo-Synephrine and dopamine.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the [**Known patient firstname **] developed several
runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.  She was given
lidocaine and amiodarone.  Her heart rate then decreased for
which she was given atropine and epinephrine.  The [**Known patient firstname **]
was found to be in pulseless electrical activity.  Chest
compressions were undertaken and epinephrine was given.  The
[**Known patient firstname **] rhythm degenerated into ventricular fibrillation.
She received electrical defibrillation at 200, 300 and 360
joules without response.  After further cardiac
resuscitation, the [**Known patient firstname **] received an additional two more
attempts cardioversions at 360 joules, epinephrine and chest
compressions without any return of function. Despite our attempts
at mechanical compression of bleeding and aggressive
attempts at correction of coagulaopathy, the [**Known patient firstname **]
succumbed and was pronounced dead at 21:15 on [**2990-8-19**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Exsanguination from head injury.
2.  Coagulopathy.
3.  Ventricular fibrillation and cardiopulmonary arrest.
