ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Motorcycle accident/trauma.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 34-year-old
male motorcyclist, who sustained a motorcycle accident in [**Location (un) 2295**] on [**2540-8-27**].  He was the helmeted driver
of a motorcycle versus car with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3576**] Coma Scale of
approximately 14 to 15 at the scene, questionable loss of
consciousness.  He was intubated on the scene of the
accident.  He was hypotensive at the scene with the blood
pressure of 90s/palp. and tachycardia to the 110s.  He was
subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital 7026**] Hospital, where he
received 10 units of packed red blood cells in eight liters
worth of crystalloid; no FFP was given at the outside
hospital.

He was transferred via [**Location (un) **] to the [**Hospital1 470**] and upon arrival he had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3576**] Coma Scale
of 3T; he was intubated at the outside hospital.  His blood
pressure was in the 120s/palp.  In the Emergency Department
he was given four units of FFP in two liters worth of
crystalloid.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination in the ER, he had
a blood pressure in the 120s/palp. and a heart rate in the
80s.  He was intubated, sedated, and paralyzed.  His pupils
were equal and reactive to light, going from 4 to 3-mm.  He
was missing a front tooth.  His tympanic membranes were
clear, bilaterally.  Trachea was midline.  His lungs were
clear to auscultation with a stable sternum.  His cardiac
examination was regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  His pelvis was unstable and he
had a large, open perineal injury-laceration with a lacerated
scrotum and exposed testicle.  He had positive blood at the
urethral meatus and a large anal tear.  His extremities
showed a large right thigh hematoma.  He did have palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  The laboratory examination was
significant for a white count of 35,000 and a hematocrit of
34 with the platelets of 126.  The INR was 2.1 with the PT of
17 and the PTT of 44.4.  His initial chest x-ray was
negative.  His pelvic showed an open-book fracture.  His
lateral C-spine film was negative through C4.  His head CT
was negative for any intracranial hemorrhage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was taken to the CT scanner, where a CT
of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, demonstrating the
following:  Right adrenal gland had adrenal hematoma with
surrounding free fluid.  The kidneys showed no evidence of
traumatic injury.  There was a small amount of free fluid
tracking down the left pericolic gutter with thickening of
the descending colon suggestive of hematoma.  The major
abdominal vasculature appeared patent.  The ureters and the
urinary bladder were normal without evidence of
extravasation.  There was an open-book pelvic fracture with
diastasis of the SI joints and multiple comminuted pelvic
fractures.  There were inferior and superior pubic rami
fractures on the left and a superior ramus fracture on the
right.  There was free fluid air and inflammatory straining
throughout the pelvis extending throughout the pelvic
musculature and the subcutaneous tissue.  A small amount of
air was seen within the central canal from L1 to S1 level.
No vertebral fractures were identified.  There was extensive
soft-tissue damage and subcutaneous air throughout the
perineum.  A CT urethrogram demonstrated extravasation of
contrast throughout the perineum and into the anterior
abdominal wall consistent with extensive urethral damage.

He had a CT of the cervical spine, which demonstrated no
fracture or dislocation.  The prevertebral soft-tissue
structure appeared normal.

In summary, in the emergency room this was a 30-year-old man,
who sustained a motorcycle accident with a severe pelvic
fracture and open perineum.  His past medical history was
unknown at the time.  He was on no medications and he had no
known drug allergies.  He occasionally smoked.  There was no
evidence of alcohol use.  Given his injuries, a GU surgery
consultation, as well as a orthopedic consultation was
obtained.  The patient was taken to the operating room
immediately, where the following procedures were performed:
External fixation of his pelvic fracture, after an
exploratory laparotomy and loop transverse colostomy
performed, as well as debridement and packing of the
extensive perineal wound.  A scrotoplasty was also performed
with placement of a suprapubic tube.  The patient was then
transferred to the ICU.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had an extensive Intensive Care
Unit stay.  He spent his initial 32 days at the [**Hospital1 47**] in the Intensive Care Unit.  He also
required blood transfusions and repeated operative
debridements of his perineal wound.

A brief summary of his Intensive Care Unit stay is as
follows:  The patient was in the Intensive Care Unit for 32
days and underwent five debridement and washouts of his
perineal wound, as follows:  He was taken to the operating
room on [**8-31**], 19th, 21st, 22nd and 27th.  The wound
itself extended between the scrotum and anus.  It transected
the urethra at the level of the prostatic urethra and
required deep packing.

The patient did well from his initial surgery; however,
developed high fevers postoperatively, within the first
twenty-four hours postoperatively with a temperature maximum
of 103 on the 3rd postoperative day.  His fevers persisted
and he was taken back for a debridement of his perineal
wound, where hematoma, but no pus was found.  However,
subsequent operative cultures grew out E. coli from his
perineal wound and he required several debridements of this
perineal infection.  He also initially grew out E. coli from
his sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from his first
several days in the Intensive Care Unit for which he was
treated.  The patient received extensive antibiotic coverage
with approximately 10 days of Vancomycin, 10 days of
Fluconazole, and 37 days of gram-negative antibiotics,
initially with Gentamicin from [**8-28**] to the 22nd,
which was changed to Ceftriaxone, which he has been on for
the duration of his hospital stay as well as 21 days of
Flagyl.

The repeated debridements were the reason why Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was
kept intubated for such a prolonged period of time, and for
that reason he required a percutaneous tracheostomy on
[**9-15**].  He received TPN for nutritional support
until [**9-19**], where a percutaneous jejunostomy tube was
placed and parenteral feedings were begun.

The orthopedic surgeons were hesitant to initially fix his
open-book pelvic fracture.  The patient was going to require
sacral pins across his sacroiliac joint, and the orthopedist
did not want to perform any internal fixation until it was
felt that his perineal wound was clean without evidence of
infection.  By [**9-22**], the patient's wound seemed well
enough that he was taken to the operating room by the
orthopedist, where the replacement of the external fixator
was performed and the patient had posterior iliosacral bolt
fixation of his sacroiliac-joint disruption.  He was slowly
weaned from his Ativan and Dilaudid drips that he required
for sedation while in the Intensive Care Unit.  By [**9-28**], after 32 days in the ICU, he was well enough that he
was ready for transferred to the floor.  At that point, the
patient had made remarkable progress.  He was alert and
conversant, tolerating his tube feeds, and eager to begin a
rehabilitative course.  He was tolerating a Passy-Muir valve,
and he was speaking.  He was transferred to the floor on
[**9-28**], however, within 10 hours of being on the floor,
the patient vomited after suctioning and had a change in his
mental status with a decreased level of consciousness.

The patient was having increased respiratory secretions
requiring frequent pulmonary toilet and his white count,
which had been in the low teens, rose to 30,000.  He was
transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit; given a high
suspicion for aspiration, and he was placed on Levofloxacin
and Flagyl, in addition to the Ceftriaxone, which he had been
receiving.

Over the next couple of days the patient made a steady
recovery and was transferred back to the floor on [**10-4**].

Of note, on [**10-3**], he had a dysphagia evaluated ORL,
which demonstrated signs and symptoms at the bedside, for
which he continued to be NPO with jejunostomy feedings.  He
did have urine cultures which were sent, which grew out
Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus for which he was
re-evaluated by infectious disease, who felt that no further
treatment was indicated.  His Levofloxacin and Flagyl were
stopped and he was continued on Ceftriaxone.

By hospital day #40 on [**10-6**], the patient was doing
very well.  He remained afebrile.  He was tolerating his tube
feeds, making good urine output.  His abdomen was soft.  His
ostomy was pink, patent, and productive.  He was nontender.
His pelvis had an external fixator in place.  His peroneal
wound was granulating well.  His white count was 16,000;
however, he demonstrated no signs of systemic infection, and
this was felt to be an inflammatory response secondary to the
extensive injuries he had sustained.  He did have a slight
elevation of his amylase and lipase, which were on the
decline and not felt to be clinically significant at this
time.  He was tolerating physical therapy and able to stand.
His medications, at that time, were Lovenox 30 mg
subcutaneously b.i.d.; Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers;
Zantac; and Ativan, p.r.n.  Of note, he did have an IVC
filter placed on [**8-28**], on his initial admission for
DVT prophylaxis.

Review by systems of this patient at the time of discharge
was as follows:

Neurologically, he had a behavioral neuropsychiatry consult
pending.  He was cognitively intact, requiring some Ativan
for sedation.

From a respiratory standpoint, he was stable with a
tracheostomy, tolerating a Passy-Muir valve for phonation.

Cardiovascularly, he was stable without any issues.

Gastrointestinal:  He was tolerating his tube feeds of Impact
fiber at 95 cc per hour.

Genitourinary:  He had a suprapubic catheter in place, as
well as a Foley catheter through his urethra bridging that
transected the transection of the bulbous and prostatic
urethra.  He was instructed to followup with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5667**], whose phone # was [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8135**], for further GU
intervention as would be needed.

Hematology:  He had a leukocytosis, which was stable in
nature.

Infectious Disease:  He was on Ceftriaxone for a completion
course until [**10-13**], given his pelvic fractures with
open wounds.

From a prophylaxis standpoint, he had an IVC filter in place,
as well as Lovenox.  At this point, he was stable for
discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ativan 0.5 mg per J-tube q.i.d.
2.  Impact with fiber 95 cc per hour per J-tube.
3.  Tylenol 650 mg per J-tube q. 4-6h. p.r.n.
4.  Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneously b.i.d.
5.  Albuterol/Atrovent two puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
6.  Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV q.24h. until [**10-13**].
7.  Zantac 150 mg per J-tube b.i.d. in elixir form.

He was also receiving t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing changes to
his perineum with Kerlix.

FOLLOW-UP CARE:  He was instructed to followup with Trauma
Surgery.  The Trauma Surgery Clinic phone # was [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1937**]
with Orthopedic Surgery, specifically with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8136**] and
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5667**] of GU Surgery.
