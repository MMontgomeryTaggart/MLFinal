History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8171**] is a 79 yo male with hx of CAD, CHF, Afib, AS s/p
[**Known patient lastname **], DM2 who presents from [**Hospital 209**] Rehab with staph bacteremia
[**12-11**] and [**12-12**] in need of a TEE. Patient was discharged from
[**Hospital1 68**] on [**2790-11-29**]. He was admitted at that time for increasing
dependence on the vent and was thought to have a VAP and
questionable CHF exacerbation. He was diuresed daily and treated
with levaquin for stenotrophomonas pna. Patient was also able to
be weaned from the vent and was discharged on trach mask with
50% FIO2. Patient then went to [**Hospital 209**] Rehab and during his
course there developed a klebsiella UTI and pna and is being
treated with cefaclor per sensitivities. Start date of cefaclor
appears to be [**12-8**]. On [**12-10**], patient spiked a fever to 101
rectally and blood cultures were drawn. He has been afebrile
since then. He also had a rising white count from 8-->13 noted
on [**12-11**] with diarrhea and was started on po vanco empirically.
Blood cultures from [**12-11**] and [**12-12**] are growing out staph aureus
and patient was sent to [**Hospital1 68**] for TEE since he has recent
history of [**Hospital1 **]. Also has stage 4 pressure ulcer on right foot
which could also be causing the fever and bacteremia as there is
a question of osteomyelitis.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2790-12-13**] 6:16 PM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-25**] through 18:
Extensive infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has improved since
[**11-29**] and previous moderate bilateral pleural effusions
have decreased, consistent with improving pulmonary edema.
Residual abnormality could represent pneumonia to some degree.
Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette due to
cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion is unchanged.
Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. No pneumothorax or
mediastinal widening.
.
FOOT 2 VIEWS PORT RIGHT  [**2790-12-14**] 10:16 AM
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.
.
TEE [**2790-12-14**]:
A small secundum atrial septal defect/stretched PFO is seen with
color Doppler (cine loop #60). The left atrium is dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). The right atrium is dilated. There is
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular
systolic function appears preserved. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta, arch and descending aorta. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis (but may be
slightly UNDERestimated on this study). No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. A paravalvular jet of moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The jet emanates from the
posterolateral aspect of the aortic annulus, adjacent to the
left sinus of Valsalva. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. Moderate paravalvular
prosthetic aortic regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79 yo with CAD, CHF, DM2 who presents with bacteremia
growing staph.
.
#. Staph bacteremia- Patient had positive blood cultures with
coag + Staph at rehab and GPC in one BCx bottle at [**Hospital1 68**]. TEE
was negative for endocarditis. GS from foot decub showed coag
negative staph and diptheriae (likely contaminate). He continued
to have high white count despite treatment, though he was never
febrile during his stay. Surveillance blood cultures taken after
[**2790-12-13**] showed no growth several days after drawn.  He was
continued on vancomycin IV throughout his stay.  Sensitivities
of the original positive blood culture showed MRSA that was
sensitive to Bactrim.  Per vascular, the decision was made to
treat the infection as if he has osteomyelitis.  The plan is to
continue IV vancomycin for a total of 6 weeks to end, last day
[**2791-1-16**].
.
#. Klebsiella UTI- diagnosed at rehab and treated with cefaclor
for 7 days before admission. He was continued on ceftriaxone
(cefaclor is not formulary at [**Hospital1 68**], though sensitivies from
rehab showed that it was sensitive to ceftriaxone).  Urine
culture from [**12-13**] negative.  The plan is to continue the
ceftriaxone for a total of 14 days of cefaclor/ceftriaxone, last
day [**12-26**].
.
#. Afib: Patient has chronic afib and had periods of RVR on [**12-15**]
which were controlled with his usual scheduled dose of
metoprolol. Patient is anticoagulated with coumadin. Will check
coags on admission. His INR was therapeutic during his stay and
his rate was controlled with his home metoprolol dose. He was
monitored on telemetry.
.
#. Ulcer right foot- Patient has a stage 2 and stage 4 pressure
ulcer on right foot, one on his heel and the other on the sole
of his foot. Podiatry and vascular were consulted.  GS from foot
sole decub grew coag negative staph and diptheriae (likely
contaminate). Foot xray showing no evidence of osteomyelitis,
but should be treated as if he has osteo per vascular for 6
weeks. Vasculary surgery also reccomended against chemical or
surgical debridement.  He was continued on IV vancomycin and
micro data as above.
.
#. Positive sputum- patient appears to be colonized with
stenotrophomonas as he has previous sputum cultures showing
stenotrophomonas. His CXR was not worsening and he was afebrile.
He was not treated specifically for pna given the likelihood of
the stenotrophomonas being a colonizer.
.
#. Diarrhea- On empiric flagyl for c dif as patient is on
antibiotics and had diarrhea at OSH. C dif was pending at rehab
at the time of admission.  Started on po vanco empirically as
well at rehab. This could also be the source of his rising WBC,
though he is currently without diarrhea. Here, he has had C.diff
negative x2. He was continued on Flagyl and po vanco
empirically. He should have 7 more days of both Flagyl and PO
Vanc, last day [**12-26**].
.
#. AoCRF- He had a small increase in his renal failure above
baseline.  It improved during his stay.
.
#. CAD- stable. No current ischemic symptoms. Ekg is unchanged
from prior.
He was continued on asa, simvastatin, metoprolol
.
#. CHF: ECHO as above. Patient had EF of 50%. On exam, patient
appeared euvolemic.  No further intervention was done.
.
#. DM2: He was continued on glargine and covered with humalog
sliding scale.
.
#. Hyperkalemia: He had a potassium level of 146 on [**12-16**] which
was treated by increasing his free water flushes in his tube
feeds.
.
#. FEN: He was given tube feeds- nutren renal at 35 cc/hr and
35g beneprotein with water flushes.
.
#. PPx: lansoprazole, no heparin products given history of HIT,
venodynes, bowel regimen
.
#. Code: He was determined to be DNR/DNI by family discussion
.
#. Access: He has very poor access.  He was given a PICC by IR
on [**12-17**].
.
#. Communication: HCP is daughter [**Name (NI) 8172**] [**Name (NI) 7777**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8173**] and
wife [**Name (NI) 8174**] [**Name (NI) 8171**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8175**]

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8171**] was treated at [**Hospital1 68**] for MRSA bacteremia and right
foot ulcers stage 2 and 4.  He was started on a six week course
of IV vancomycin for the bacteremia on [**12-12**].  He had one
positive blood culture while here.  He was seen by vascular and
podiatry and no debridement was undertaken, but it was felt that
he should be treated as if he had osteomyelitis (despite
negative foot xray) since the ulcer on the sole of his foot is
deep to bone. He also had a negative TEE to address the
possibility of endocarditis.

His vancomycin trough levels should be followed as his level was
too high on the morning of [**2790-12-18**] so his dosing was decreased
to 1g q 36 hours.

He was changed from cefoclor to ceftriaxone for his klebsiella
uti as cefoclor is not on the [**Hospital1 68**] formulary.  He should get a
total of 14 days of treatment with the cefoclor/ceftriaxone.

He was continued on metoprolol for his afib, which other than
one brief episode of RVR which resolved with his regular dose of
metoprolol, he was well controlled.

He was continued on his PO vancomycin for cdiff coverage which
was started before he was admitted.  We were unable to check him
for cdiff while in the ICU.

He should be returned to the ED if he becomes febrile or septic
or if he has any other concerning symptoms.


Followup Instructions:
He should follow up with his primary care physician in the next
7 to 10 days.
