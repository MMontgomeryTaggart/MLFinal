HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4535**] is a 44-year-old
man with a history of type 1 diabetes times 33 years,
coronary artery disease, hypertension, status post coronary
artery bypass grafting in [**2758-10-23**] who presented
initially to [**Hospital6 1206**] following 24 hours of
epigastric pain and nausea, which he described as
intermittent and relieved with antacids.  There was
associated vomiting on the morning of admission.  There was
no chest pain or shortness of breath.  The patient stated
that he was febrile at home to a temperature of 100.5.  He
describes the abdominal discomfort as different from his
usual anginal pain.

At the outside hospital, patient was noted to have [**Street Address(2) 3316**]
elevations in leads III and aVF and [**Street Address(2) 1747**] elevations in
leads II and V4 through V6.  CK was elevated at 658 with an
MB fraction of 48.3 and a troponin I of 1.18.  He remained
free of chest pain.  He was given aspirin, heparin drip,
Lopressor, nitropasted, sublingual nitroglycerin and
transferred to [**Hospital6 656**] for
emergency cardiac catheterization.

In the catheterization laboratory, patient was found to have
diffuse three vessel disease with a saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery graft with a 100% proximal
occlusion, a saphenous vein graft to OM2 vein 99% occlusion,
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
graft which was patent.  He received percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary
artery with stenting as well as a stent of the saphenous vein
graft to OM2.  He was started on Integrilin and admitted to
the Coronary Care Unit.  At the time of admission he was
without complaint.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for intermittent diarrhea times
two weeks.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft times three vessels:  Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending; saphenous vein graft to
OM1; saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
2.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, with q.i.d.
fingersticks and dosing.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Status post laser surgery to his eyes.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  Patient states no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Humulin N 36 units q.a.m., 12
units q.p.m., Humalog sliding scale, Lopressor 25 mg po
b.i.d., iron sulfate 325 mg po t.i.d., enteric coated aspirin
325 mg po q.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient is status post coronary artery
bypass grafting at the age of 60.  His brother is status post
myocardial infarction at the age of 46.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a bookkeeper for a truck
firm.  He denies tobacco and occasionally uses alcohol.  He
denies street drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's temperature was 99.  Heart
rate 95.  Respiratory rate 22.  Blood pressure 148/70.  In
general, he was alert, lying flat following catheterization
in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
exam:  Indicated normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular
muscles were intact.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to
light.  Sclera were anicteric.  Oral mucosa were moist.  The
neck was supple without jugular venous distention.  The chest
was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam
indicated a regular rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with normal bowel sounds.  Extremity exam:  The patient had
2+ peripheral pulses with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
His right groin was without hematoma or bruit.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Initially indicated a white blood cell
count of 14.2, hematocrit of 37.7, platelets 386,000.
Coagulation studies were within normal limits.  Chem-7 was
normal with the exception of a creatinine of 1.3, which is
the patient's baseline.  Electrocardiogram from the outside
hospital indicated normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 92,
normal axis, [**Street Address(2) 1747**] depression in lead II and aVF and [**Street Address(2) 8758**] elevations in lead III with [**Street Address(2) 3316**] depressions in lead
aVL.  Poor R wave progression and T wave inversions in lead
V6.

Cardiac catheterization results indicated a cardiac output of
4.4.  Cardiac index of 2.53, wedge pressure of 13.  Pulmonary
artery pressure of 29/15.

Catheterization results are as follows:  Left main normal,
left anterior descending 60%, mid at 90% distal stenosis,
left circumflex artery 80% proximal and 80% mid stenosis,
right coronary artery 30% proximal and mid stenosis with a
99% posterior descending artery stenosis and a 90% stenosis
of the distal segment beyond the posterior descending artery.
Saphenous vein graft to OM2 indicated 99% stenosis.
Saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery indicated
100% proximal stenosis.  Left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending was patent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Intensive Care Unit for follow-up of cardiac catheterization
and hemodynamic monitoring on telemetry.  The following is
the hospital course by system:

1.  Cardiovascular:  Patient remained hemodynamically stable.
His enzymes peaked at a CK of 767, MB of 43 and a troponin of
greater than 50.  He remained free of chest pain during his
hospital course with no further electrocardiogram changes.
Lipid panel indicated total cholesterol of 143, HDL of 29,
LDL of 97 and triglycerides of 83.  Echocardiogram indicated
a 60-65% ejection fraction with mild left ventricular
hypertrophy and mildly dilated aortic root and 1+ mitral
regurgitation.  The patient was started on metoprolol and
titrated up.  He was also started on Lipitor 40 mg po q.h.s.,
Plavix, aspirin and folic acid, as well as an ACE inhibitor.
As patient remained stable for the four days following
cardiac catheterization, and was cleared for discharge home
by Physical Therapy, he was sent home on hospital day number
four with Cardiology follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8759**] at 4:45
p.m. on [**1-7**].  He was to have a repeat catheterization
with possible brachytherapy in two to three months.

2.  Infectious Disease:  On hospital day number two, the
patient spiked a temperature overnight.  Cultures were drawn
which were negative.  The patient had no symptoms.  His
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea resolved during his hospital
course and was thought to be secondary to a possible viral
gastroenteritis.

3.  Endocrine:  The patient was restarted on his outpatient
regimen of humulin and Humalog sliding scale in order to
achieve maximal glycemic control during this post myocardial
infarction period.  On hospital day number three, sugars
began to be elevated in a 200-300 range.  This was corrected
by increasing the insulin dose.  At the time of discharge,
the patient had been setup with a follow-up appointment in
the [**Hospital 124**] Clinic.  He was to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on
[**2-24**] at 9:30 a.m.

4.  Neurologic:  The patient was noted to have a bilateral
peripheral neuropathy involving loss of sensation in his
thumb, second and third digits bilaterally.  This was thought
to be possibly secondary to his coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.  Patient would be followed in the Neurology Clinic
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 958**] on [**1-8**] at 10:30 a.m.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:

4.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d. times 30 days.

1.  Acute inferolateral myocardial infarction.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
