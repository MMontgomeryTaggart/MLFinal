HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] has a history of
small cell lung cancer.  She was admitted to the medical
intensive care unit after being found with hypoxic
respiratory failure at her nursing home.  At the time of
presentation to [**Hospital1 58**] she was
febrile with an absolute neutrophil count of 40.  She
required large amounts of intravenous fluid and hemodynamic
support from her time of presentation.  On arrival in the
NICU she was on Neo-Synephrine and Levophed.  She was also on
mechanical ventilation at that time.  She reached maximum
doses on Neo-Synephrine and Levophed.  At that point
Vasopressin was added.  Despite these measures, it was
difficult to maintain her blood pressure.  Her oxygenation
and ventilation continued to decline over several hours.
Despite numerous interventions on the mode of ventilation and
numerous boluses of intravenous fluid, the patient was unable
to maintain a blood pressure sufficient to profuse her vital
organs.  She passed away on the evening of [**2628-10-24**].
