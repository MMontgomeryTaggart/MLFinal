Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 17 year-old
female with no significant past medical history who was
brought in by med flight to the [**Hospital1 1499**] on [**2997-10-16**].  The patient was the front seat
passenger in an automobile.  She was unrestrained and was
ejected through the front windshield.  There was positive
loss of consciousness.  In the field the patient was
intubated.  Systolic blood pressure was found to be in the
130s.  There was significant damage to the car.  The patient
had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3576**] coma scale of 6 or 7 at the scene.  In the
Emergency Department she was found to have [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3576**] coma
scale of 3T.  She was hemodynamically stable.  She had a
notable right arm deformity.  She was reportedly complaining
of abdominal pain at the scene.  She had been at [**Hospital 7026**]
Hospital the same day for workup of possible pregnancy.  This
was negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Ovarian cyst.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient's family lives in [**State 210**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial vital signs showed heart rate
of 68, blood pressure 121/54, oxygen sat was 100% on room
air.  The patient was intubated and sedated.  Her pupils were
3 to 2 bilaterally and equal.  Tympanic membranes were clear
bilaterally.  Her trachea was midline.  There were multiple
superficial facial abrasions.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The right chest had lateral
superficial abrasions.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Pelvis was
stable.  The rectal examination was normal sphincter tone and
no guaiac positivity.  Extremities revealed multiple
superficial ecchymosis and a gross deformity of the right
arm. There was a palpable pulse and brisk capillary refill.
The back was without step offs.  There were multiple
superficial abrasions.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count 20.9, hematocrit
29.9, platelets 318, sodium 143, potassium 3.3, chloride 111,
CO2 20, BUN 7, creatinine 0.9, glucose 129, amylase 59, PT
14.1, INR 1.4, PTT 33.6, fibrinogen 145, lactate 3.0.
Urinalysis showed large blood, 100 protein.  Toxicology
screen showed an ethanol level of 11.  Multiple radiologic
studies were undertaken while the patient was in the
Emergency Department.  A C spine film revealed a C7
transverse process fracture.  There was posterior
displacement and anterior fracture of C7.  A chest x-ray
showed scoliosis, left apical caping suggestive of an aortic
injury and a right main stem bronchus intubation.  Pelvic
film showed a right superior ramus fracture, right inferior
ramus fracture and bilateral sacral iliac fractures.  The
patient was stable and transferred to the CT scanner.  CT of
the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a mediastinal hematoma
extending to the left apex and adjacent to the descending
intrathoracic aorta.  There was no active extravasation, but
aortic dissection was not rule out.  Number two was right
upper lobe liver laceration and contusion.  Possible
aspiration pneumonia, multiple fractures involving C7, T1,
right scapular, right iliac bone, right sacrum and right
superior and inferior pubic symphyses, splenic laceration
with active contrast extravasation.

The patient was admitted promptly to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit.  Both cardiothoracic surgery and orthopedic
surgery were consulted urgently.  On [**2997-10-17**] the patient had
an aortogram.  This revealed a normal thoracic aorta with no
contour irregularities or contrast extravasation.  An MR of
the cervical spine was obtained, which showed a burst
fracture involving the C7 vertebral body, but no intrinsic
signal abnormality within the cord itself.  There was
disruption of the left facet joint at C6-7, C7 to T1 and
fractures at C7.  There was also a fracture seen at T1.
Orthopedic Surgery saw the patient and determined that the
patient would benefit from operative management.  She
underwent anterior cervical decompression and fusion from C6
to T1 on [**2997-10-23**].  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was returned to the Intensive Care Unit.

The patient remained there for several days.  She slowly
began to improve.  Her course was complicated only by a
pneumonia, which was initially treated with Vancomycin and
then tailored to Oxacillin and Levofloxacin after Methacillin
sensitive staph aureus and hemophilus influenza grew out from
her cultures.  She was maintained nutritionally with tube
feeds.  The remainder of her fractures including her right
humerus fracture were managed nonoperatively.  The patient's
intra-abdominal injuries were also managed conservatively
with observation and strict bed rest.  The patient remained
stable and gradually had decreased discomfort in her abdomen.
An IVC filter was placed for PE prophylaxis.

Neurosurgery was then consulted to evaluate the patient.  It
was recommended to get another CT scan of the head to rule
out subdural or subarachnoid bleed.  The CT scan was
negative.  Neurobehavioral Service was also consulted.  It
was determined that the patient had findings consistent with
the diffuse external injury type of severe traumatic brain
injury.  They anticipated that her amnesia and confusion
should improve over time particularly with active
rehabilitation.  On [**2997-10-30**], the patient was transferred to
the hospital [**Hospital1 **].  She began feeding slowly.  She had a TLSO
brace, which allows her to be removed from bed.  The only
subsequently complication on the floor was a marked
thrombocytosis to platelets greater then one million.  This
is now gradually resolving and thought to be an acute phase
reaction from trauma.  Her pneumonia has resolved nicely and
her white blood cell count has drastically decreased to near
normal levels.

On [**2997-11-1**], interventional radiology removed the patient's
IVC filter without complication.  On [**2997-11-2**] the patient is
doing much better.  She is eating.  She is performing her
physical therapy.  She is more awake and alert.  It is felt
that she will benefit from an aggressive rehabilitation stay.
 Placement is pending currently.
