HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 38-year-old white male
who has had recurrent episodes of severe chest pain.  He had
a cardiac catheterization in [**3465**] which was negative for
coronary artery disease.

Then in [**3468-6-16**], he was admitted with severe chest pain,
diaphoresis, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting and
ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  An exercise tolerance
test at that time revealed a possible left anterior
descending infarction, and an echocardiogram revealed
worsening mitral regurgitation.

On [**3468-7-13**] he was again admitted with chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 58**].  He ruled out for a
myocardial infarction, but he had a positive toxicology
screen for cocaine.  An echocardiogram on [**7-14**] revealed a
left-to-right shunt across the intraatrial septum, secundum
as atrial septal defect, and an ejection fraction of 75
percent.  His mitral valve leaflets were myxomatous and
elongated, and he had moderate-to-severe mitral valve
prolapse with partial mitral leaflet flare and 4 plus mitral
regurgitation.

He had a stress test on [**7-15**] which revealed no significant
ST changes.  He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**8-7**]
which revealed an ejection fraction of 71 percent, normal
coronaries, and 4 plus mitral regurgitation.  He is now
admitted for elective mitral valve repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a history of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, a heart murmur for 12
years, mild L5-S1 disc protrusion, history of migraines,
status post motor vehicle accident with chronic leg pain and
low back pain requiring narcotics, a history of BPH, history
of hemorrhoids, history of anxiety, history of depression,
and a history of substance abuse.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married.  He works as an automobile
mechanic but has not worked in several months.  He smoked
half a pack per day until recently and now smokes one to two

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Elavil
50 mg p.o. q.h.s., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 10 mg
p.o. q.d., Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d., Percocet one to two
tablets by mouth q.4-6h. as needed, Klonopin 1 mg p.o.
b.i.d., and he was on a prednisone taper for hives.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He was a well-developed
and well-nourished white male in no apparent distress.  Vital
signs were stable.  Afebrile.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
The extraocular movements were intact.  The oropharynx had
poor dentition.  The neck was supple with full range of
motion.  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  The carotids
were 2 plus and equal bilaterally.  No bruits.  The lungs
were clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a
holosystolic murmur.  The abdomen was soft and nontender with
positive bowel sounds.  No masses or hepatosplenomegaly.  The
extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**9-4**], the patient
underwent a mitral valve repair with a quadrangular resection
of the posterior leaflet, and an anuloplasty with a 30-mm
[**Doctor Last Name 1326**] band, and a closure of a small atrial septal defect.
He was ready to leave the Operating Room and had some
increased chest tube drainage.  He was reopened in the
Operating Room, but by that time platelets and fresh frozen
plasma had been transfused and his coagulopathy had resolved.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery
Unit and was started on Precedex.  He remained intubated
overnight and was extubated on postoperative day one.  He had
his chest tubes discontinued on postoperative day two and was
transferred to the floor.  On postoperative day three and had
his pacing wires discontinued.  He had a lot of pain
management issues and required respiratory therapy.

He was ready for discharge on postoperative day five but
spiked a temperature to 101.6.  He was fully cultured, which
was negative.  His white count was 6700 and remained afebrile
after that and was discharged to home on postoperative day
six in stable condition.

LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  Her laboratories on discharge
were a hematocrit of 29, white count of 6500, and platelets
of 319.  Sodium was 141, potassium was 4, chloride was 105,
bicarbonate was 31, blood urea nitrogen was 10, and
creatinine was 0.8.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Potassium 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. (for seven days).
2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
