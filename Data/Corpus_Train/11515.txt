.
CXR: FINDINGS: No focal consolidation is seen. No pneumothorax
is seen.  Prominent hila and elevation of the left hilum are
unchanged compared to prior. Heart size is within normal limits
and unchanged. Calcification of the mitral annulus is again
seen. Left atrial enlargement is noted on lateral view. The
aorta is calcified. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.
Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is unchanged and likely
represents scarring.  IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for
acute pulmonary abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
99 F with history of prior diverticulitis 12 years ago and GI
bleed two years ago managed conservatively (no scope) who
presented with BRBPR and falling Hct in the setting of
suprtherapeutic INR to 4.7.
.
1. GI BLEED: Given painless GIB, likely LGIB in setting of
supratherapeutic INR from interaction of TMP/SMX with coumadin.
Patient was treated conservatively with reversal of
supratherapeutic INR with FFP and vitamin K, and transfusion
with PRBC. Total transfusion requirement was 3 units PRBC and 3
units FFP.  Patient was evaluated by Gastroenterology during
admission, with further diagnostic/therapeutic procedures
including colonoscopy deferred. HCT remained stable following
transfusion. She continued to have small volume guaiac positive
stools, but believed to represent old blood in right colon.
Coumadin held at discharge.
.
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient with known PAF on coumadin, with
supratherapeutic INR on admission that was reversed as above.
Coumadin was held during hospital course and at discharge.
Decision will be made as outpatient visit regarding the
initiation of aspirin therapy.
.
3. ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Believed to be pre-renal
etiology in the setting of bleeding and poor appetite.

during presentation given bleed and anemia. Will be re-started

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9788**],
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 **]. You were admitted to the hospital with rectal

counts remained stable prior to your discharge from the
hospital.

COUMADIN
LISINOPRIL
AMLODIPINE

Please discuss re-starting your blood pressure medications with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2253**] when you see her in follow-up. You should also
discuss the use of Aspirin (in place of coumadin) at your
follow-up appointment.
.
If you experience any further epsisodes of bleeding, abdominal
pain, dizziness or weakness, please call your primary care
doctor or return to the emergency room.
.
