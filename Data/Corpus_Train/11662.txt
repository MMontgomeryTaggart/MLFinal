HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 74-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft in [**2796-10-24**], with
multiple complications, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 47**] from [**Hospital3 1096**] for management
of question of possible empyema.  The patient has a
complicated past medical history.  Please see past medical
history.  The patient was hospitalized here in the month of
[**Month (only) 354**] for respiratory failure with pseudomonas pneumonia,
cryptococcemia and amiodarone-induced lung disease.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 1096**] on [**1-21**].
He was weaned from the ventilator there, although he required
high FIO2.  Ten days prior to admission, the patient
developed increased shortness of breath with bilateral
pleural effusions.  The right-sided effusion was tapped, and
grew vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.  Linezolid was
started, with clinical improvement, but four days later, the
patient had increased shortness of breath and pseudomonas in
the sputum, sensitive only to amikacin.  One day prior to
admission, the left-sided effusion was tapped.  Cultures were
pending at the time of transfer, but the pH was noted to be
7.08.  Blood pressure has also been decreased over the last
several days, requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation.
Sputum was also noted to be positive for methicillin
resistant staphylococcus aureus on [**2797-2-20**].

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Infectious Disease:  The patient presented with bilateral
pleural effusions, with recently-tapped left pleural effusion
with a reported pH of 7.08.  On presentation to this
hospital, the patient underwent chest tube placement for
tapping of bilateral pleural effusions.  Right pleural
effusion was notable for the following laboratory findings:
56 white blood cells, 33,625 red blood cells, protein of 3.2,
glucose of 44, LDH of [**2731**], pH of 7.94, Gram stain revealing
1+ polys.  Left-sided pleural effusion notable for 384,000
red blood cells, 378 white blood cells, 55% polys, protein of
2.9, glucose of 63, LDH of 630, amylase of 11, pH of 7.50,
Gram stain revealed 2+ polys.  Cultures and cytology were
negative.  Ultimately pleural fluid culture did grow out
vancomycin-resistant enterococcus from one bottle, which was
thought to be a colonizer.  Analysis of the pleural fluid
suggested that it was exudative.  It apparently was not
infectious, however.  Given the high red blood cell count and
high LDH, it was concerning for malignant effusion, but
cytology was negative.  It was also thought that there was
potentially some component of congestive heart failure
contributing to the effusions.  The patient did not, however,
present with frank evidence of congestive heart failure
during this hospitalization, though with an echocardiogram
that showed no change from prior.

Regarding other Infectious Disease issues, the patient's
stool was sent for C. difficile, which was negative.  Blood
was positive for cryptococcal antigen, and the patient was
continued on his fluconazole.  Blood cultures, both bacterial
and mycolytic cultures, were negative.  Sputum cultures taken
early in this hospitalization grew out multi-drug-resistant
pseudomonas, as has been colonized in the past.  The urine
also grew out resistant pseudomonas.  The patient was covered
broadly with two anti-pseudomonal drugs, namely amikacin and
piperacillin/tazobactam.  Sensitivities revealed that the
organism was sensitive to both of these.  Cerebrospinal fluid
cryptococcal antigen was not sent, but had been negative in
[**2796-12-24**].  The patient did grow vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus in the pleural fluid in the setting of treatment
with linezolid.  This was treated as a colonizer, and was not
specifically treated during this hospitalization.  The
patient did show evidence of oral thrush, and was treated
with Nystatin and continued on his fluconazole.

2.  Pulmonary:  As noted above, the patient was treated with
amikacin and Zosyn for pseudomonal respiratory tract
infection.  The organism was not cultured from the pleural
fluid, and the pleural fluid analysis was not entirely
consistent with an infectious etiology.  Per Infectious
Disease service recommendations, the patient should receive a
three week course of antibiotic treatment with these
anti-pseudomonal agents.  The patient should also receive at
least an additional six weeks total therapy with fluconazole
for cryptococcal pneumonia, as the patient has a history of
cryptococcemia.  The patient remained ventilator dependent
during this hospitalization secondary to multifactorial
pulmonary processes, namely pneumonia, possible amiodarone
toxicity, and bilateral pleural effusions of mixed etiology,
possibly with components of both transudate and exudate.  The
patient's chest x-ray revealed pulmonary infiltrates thought
to reflect prior amiodarone toxicity vs. new ventilator
associated or hospital-acquired pneumonia.  The patient
remained essentially afebrile throughout the remainder of his
hospitalization, with several low-grade fevers on [**3-2**] and
[**2797-3-3**], for which cultures were sent.  These cultures
remained negative.  The patient continued on his antibiotics.
It was noted that he continued to grow moderate pseudomonas
from his oropharynx despite treatment with amikacin and
Zosyn.  The patient did very well on trials of pressure
support of 5, with PEEP of 5, during the last two days of his
hospitalization.  On [**2797-3-3**], the patient went for
approximately seven hours on pressure support of 5, with
little difficulty.  He was switched back to pressure support
of 12 in the evening.  He continued to have thick secretions.
Ideally the patient will be weaned from the ventilator and
then fitted for a fenestrated trach so that he may talk using
the trach.

3.  Congestive heart failure:  Patient with a history of
coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft.  He was continued on his aspirin.  The patient's beta
blocker was held for much of this hospitalization, given low
blood pressures. The patient was initiated on an ACE
inhibitor, which he seemed to tolerate well.  This was done,
in part, given suspicion that congestive heart failure was
possibly contributing to his bilateral pleural effusions.
Regarding his history of congestive heart failure, the
patient had a recent echocardiogram revealing ejection
fraction of greater than 55%.  The patient had a repeat
echocardiogram during this hospitalization, which again
showed ejection fraction greater than 55%, abnormal septal
motion consistent with a right ventricular pressure overload,
1+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation.  The
patient received several one-time doses of 40 mg of
intravenous lasix for suspicion for total volume overload.
The patient, however, did not have any clear evidence of
acute congestive heart failure compromising his oxygenation
during this hospitalization.

Regarding history of atrial fibrillation, the patient had
several periods of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response, although he had never had any associated
hemodynamic instability.  For the most part, he remained on
Diltiazem with good rate control.  He remained off of chronic
anticoagulation, which had been previously discontinued in
the setting of upper gastrointestinal bleed.

4.  Hematology:  Patient with anemia, noted to have a slow
drop in his hematocrit of approximately 6 to 7 points over
approximately a week or two.  He is guaiac negative, and had
no evidence of acute bleeding.  Anemia laboratories were
consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  The patient was
not started on iron therapy, given his iron to total iron
binding capacity ratio.  He did receive a transfusion of two
units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit bumped
appropriately and remained relatively stable.  Given the fact
that he had been revascularized, it was considered essential
to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 for cardio-protective
reasons.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  Patient with several complaints of
right upper quadrant pain early in his hospitalization, which
later resolved.  He was noted to have persistently elevated
alkaline phosphatase  and elevated GGT, although the rest of
his liver function tests were within normal limits.  There
was no evidence of any acute biliary process.  Suspicion for
gastrointestinal bleed was addressed as above.

6.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient remained
largely euvolemic.  We gave him lasix on several occasions to
keep him negative, given suspicion that congestive heart
failure may be contributing to his respiratory status and his
bilateral pleural effusions.  These effusions, however, were
evaluated toward the end of his hospitalization and found to
be stable.  His electrolytes were aggressively repleted
during this hospitalization.  He remained on tube feeds per
his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and these were
at goal.  He was, however, noted to have an approximately ten
pound weight loss during his hospitalization.

7.  Access:  Patient with a right PICC line, which he has had
in place for his antibiotic treatments since [**Month (only) 354**].  The
PICC line was changed prior to discharge so that he could
continue intravenous antibiotics for recommended periods of
time.

8.  The patient was screened by rehabilitation facilities for
ventilator rehabilitation, as he will require gradual weaning
from his ventilator.

him back to pressure support of 12 at night in order to rest
him.  The patient should receive aggressive suctioning.  He
should be continued on his antibiotics.  His PICC line should
be monitored for signs of infection.  Ultimately the patient
should be transitioned back to home.
