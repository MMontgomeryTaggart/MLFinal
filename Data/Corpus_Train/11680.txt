HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 10269**] is a 71 year old
male with a history of hypercholesterolemia, osteoarthritis
and history of previously positive PPD, who presented with no
known coronary artery disease history.  Over this past
summer, he had progressively worsening exertional substernal
chest pressure and pain, particularly noted when he was
playing golf and walking up hills.

The patient presented to his primary care physician with
these complaints.  He was then evaluated by a cardiologist,
that subsequently led to an exercise treadmill test with a
positive Cestimibi scan.  This led to a cardiac
catheterization as an outpatient, showing significant three
vessel coronary artery disease, including the left anterior
descending artery, posterior descending artery in a right
dominant system, and an obtuse marginal branch.

Due to the symptomatic chest pain/unstable angina, and the
significant three vessel coronary artery disease, the patient
was referred to the cardiothoracic surgery service with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1882**] for operative management of his disease.  Preoperative
electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no ST segment
changes or previous Q waves.  Preoperative chest x-ray was
significant for no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
Additionally, the patient had preadmission testing laboratory
studies which were significant for a hematocrit of 43 as well
as a preoperative creatinine of 1 and BUN of 26.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was subsequently taken to the
Operating Room on [**3306-12-9**], where he underwent three
vessel coronary artery bypass grafting, including conduit of
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
artery, right endoscopically harvested right saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending artery and one to the
obtuse marginal branch.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  His pericardium
was left open.  He had a right radial arterial line and a
left internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter. He left the
Operating Room with two ventricular and two atrial pacing
wires as well as two mediastinal tubes and one left pleural
tube.  He went off cardiopulmonary bypass with a mean
arterial pressure of 70, central venous pressure of 10,
pulmonary artery diastolic pressure of 14 with a mean of 18.
He was atrially paced at 90.  He was on Neo-Synephrine for
blood pressure support and propofol for sedation.

On the night of surgery, the patient was rapidly extubated in
the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit.  He was afebrile in his
postoperative course.  Laboratory data were significant for a
white blood cell count 15,000 on postoperative day number
one, hematocrit of 30, platelet count 190,000, BUN 21 and
creatinine 1.  Neurologically, he was intact.  He was started
on Lasix, Lopressor and aspirin.  His chest tubes were left
in place for some high outputs and, ultimately, he was
transferred to the floor.

By postoperative day number two, the patient was ambulating
at level III with physical therapy.  His chest tubes were
removed with a subsequent chest x-ray showing no significant
effusion and stable cardiac silhouette; just some basilar
atelectasis.  He was given aggressive pulmonary toilette with
incentive spirometry, coughing to deep breathing, and
mobilized with physical therapy.  He was given appropriate
pain control with Percocet.  He had good urine output and his
BUN and creatinine remained within normal limits.

By postoperative day number four, the patient remained
afebrile.  His wires had already been removed.  He was
ambulating at level IV and was due to complete stairs with
physical therapy.  He was afebrile, in sinus rhythm at a rate
of 78 with a blood pressure of 122/54.  His sternum was
stable with Steri-Strips in placed, open to air, no erythema,
no exudate, no evidence of drainage.  He had decreased breath
sounds at the bases.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm
without murmur, rub or gallop.  His Abdomen was soft,
nontender, with bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm and well
perfused; saphenous vein graft harvest site on the right
medial thigh clean, dry and intact.

Given the patient current presentation, the patient was
deemed stable and appropriate for discharge to home.
Discharge hematocrit was 25, BUN 24, creatinine 1, and white
blood cell count 14,000.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.q.d.
Ecotrin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
Glucosamine/chondroitin q.d.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.q.a.m. times seven days.
K-Dur 20 mEq p.o.q.d. times seven days.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d.
Lopressor 75 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o.q.4-6h.p.r.n.
Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable, afebrile, no sternal
drainage, in sinus rhythm.

DISPOSITION:  To home with VNA services.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was instructed to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1882**] in
three weeks and to see his cardiologist in two weeks.  He
will have home VNA services.  He lives at [**Location (un) 1912**] and will
be unable to return to Wound Care Clinic, so he will receive
his wound checks through the home VNA service.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed not to
drive times 30 days.  He should abstain from any heavy
lifting greater than ten pounds times 30 days.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times three, left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery and
obtuse marginal artery.
History of hypercholesterolemia.
History of osteoarthritis.
