Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. admitted and operation proceded with.  Flap applied to face
from R ant. thigh, R ant. thigh covered with STSG from L ant.
thigh.  Please see detailed Op Note for full details of this
operation.  Pt. in PACU for frequent flap checks for first 24hr
post-procedure.  Initial low UOP responded promptly to a 500cc
bolus. Pt.'s intubation continued, and pt. remained sedated and
ventilated due to tenuous nature of flap and prominent facial
edema.  Pt. transferred to ICU for further care/ventilation/q2hr
flap checks without incident.  Pt. remained hemodynamically
stable with excellent dop tones in the flap throughout this
period. An NG tube was placed and tube feeds were slowly
advanced during this time, begining on [**8-11**].  L thigh donor site
was open to air beginning on [**8-12**].  Nutrition was consulted and
provided excellent assisstance with tube feeding recs.  Pt.
extubated without incident on [**8-12**].  Tube feeds were slowly
increased and eventually moved to bolus feeds.  Facial/flap
edema slowly decreased and one drain was removed.  PT saw the
patient and assissted with post-discharge care.  Pt. came out to
floor on [**8-14**].  The Vac was taken off the R ant. thigh and the
STSG was observed to have good take.  NGT was removed and the
patient advanced to full liquids.  At some point the pt. had
transient dysuria, a U/A was done and was clean, and his
symptoms resolved.  When the patient was D/C'd his pain was well
controlled, he was tolerating PO well, and was able to ambulate
and void on his own.
