Service:  General Surgery

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain, status post cardiac stent
complicated by retroperitoneal bleed with repair and
postoperative small bowel obstruction.

PROCEDURES:
1.  Cardiac catheterization with stent of LAD.
2.  Exploration and repair of right external iliac artery
laceration.
3.  Re-exploration and repair of retroperitoneal bleeder.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
female transferred to [**Hospital1 58**] on
[**3488-2-14**] with new onset angina.  The patient was taken to the
cardiac catheterization lab on [**3488-2-15**] and was noted to have
an 80% stenosis of the mid LAD that was stented.  The
procedure was complicated by a large retroperitoneal bleed
and the patient was taken emergently to the operating room,
underwent a right external iliac repair.  Postoperatively the
patient had ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirement
and was taken back to the operating room for re-exploration
and repair of a retroperitoneal bleeder.  She stabilized
hemodynamically.  The patient was extubated on postoperative
day #6 and was transferred to the floor and required
aggressive pulmonary toilet.  She started on Levo and Flagyl
for presumptive aspiration pneumonia.  She was also noted to
have increased total bilirubin to 3.1, direct bilirubin to 2
and alkaline phosphatase to 496.  A right upper quadrant
ultrasound showed gallbladder sludge but no stones.  There
was no intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  Subsequently
the patient was noted to develop abdominal distention and
emesis as well as a white blood cell count of 15,000.  On
[**2-26**] the patient underwent a CAT scan that showed a small
bowel obstruction and an NG tube was placed with 1-2 liters
output in 24 hours.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) MI status post left circumflex
stent [**12-16**] with an EF of 50-55%.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1) Right total hip replacement.  2)
Hernia repair.  3) Appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Aspirin 325 mg po q d, Lopressor
12.5 mg po bid, Plavix - patient had completed course.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile, vital signs
are stable.  She is confused and oriented only to person.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm.  There are decreased breath
sounds at her bases bilaterally.  Her abdomen is soft,
distended, nontender, her incision is clean, dry and intact.
Extremities are soft and warm, well perfused.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted in the history of present illness,
the patient was admitted on [**2-14**] and was taken to the cath
lab.  She underwent a mid LAD stent and post procedure noted
to have a large retroperitoneal bleed.  She was taken
emergently to the OR.  This was repaired.  The right external
iliac artery was repaired.  She had ongoing hypotension and
transfusion requirement postoperatively.  She was taken back
to the operating room for re-exploration and repair of a
retroperitoneal bleeder.  Hemodynamically she stabilized and
was extubated on postoperative day #6.  She was then
transferred to the floor and was started on Levo and followed
for presumptive aspiration pneumonia.  Her LFTs were noted to
be elevated and right upper quadrant ultrasound only revealed
gallbladder sludge, no stones, no intra or extra hepatic
ductal dilatation.  She subsequently  developed abdominal
distention, emesis and a white blood cell count to 15,000.
CT scan on [**2-26**] showed distal small bowel obstruction and NG
tube was placed with approximately 2 liters output.  The
patient was then transferred to the general surgery service
for further management.  The patient's NG tube continued to
have high output.  As the patient's urine output was low, she
was aggressively hydrated, she was kept npo, she was started
on Somatostatin.  She was also started on a Heparin drip in
place of her Plavix for her cardiac stents.  Her TPN was
continued.  From a vascular standpoint the patient had an
essentially uneventful postoperative course as well.  The
patient remained npo until she was noted to have some return
of bowel function at which time her diet was advanced, her
Heparin drip was stopped, she was started on her outpatient
cardiac meds.  As she was tolerating this well and her
abdominal exam remained benign, it was decided that she would
be discharged to rehab on [**3488-3-10**] in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid, Serevent
MDI 2 puffs [**Hospital1 12**], Albuterol nebs q 4 hours prn wheezing,
Aspirin 325 mg po q d, Plavix 75 mg po q d to be taken
through [**3-18**], Haldol 1 mg po q h.s., Tylenol 650 mg po q 4-6
hours prn, Colace 100 mg po bid.  The patient was told to
call Dr.[**Name (NI) 1420**] office for follow-up as well as to call
Dr.[**Name (NI) 4702**] office for follow-up and to call her
primary care doctor as well as her cardiologist for
follow-up.  She was told to call or return for any questions
or problems.
