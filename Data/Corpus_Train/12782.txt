HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 13729**] is a 47-year-old man
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction and status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**3112**] and [**3113**] who
presented with about a [**1-10**] week history of chest discomfort
and pain which occurred sometimes with activity and sometimes
at rest.  He underwent ETT on [**3121-6-15**] that was positive and
he subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization that showed
100% occlusion of the right coronary artery and 90% of the
left main.  It was determined that coronary artery bypass
grafting would be the best treatment for Mr. [**Known patient lastname 13729**] and the
patient was scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass
grafting on [**3121-5-25**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Preoperative evaluation of this
gentleman revealed him to be 5'[**28**]" tall and 250 pounds, pulse
was 60 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 148/80, respiratory
rate 16, saturating 98% on room air.  He was in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Neck:  No jugular venous
distension.  Carotid pulses were [**1-11**] and there was no bruit.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular
in rate and rhythm without any murmur appreciated.  Abdomen:
Soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly or pulsatile
masses noted.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused with
pulses [**1-11**] in the upper and lower extremities.  Neurologic:
He was grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative hematocrit was 39.0.  His
preoperative coagulation times were PT 13.5, PTT 57.0 and INR
1.2.  His preoperative potassium was 4.3 with a BUN and
creatinine of 12 and 0.7 respectively.  His preoperative
chest x-ray showed no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality.  His EKG had shown evidence of his prior
myocardial infarction and ischemic symptoms were present.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As mentioned previously he was admitted on
[**3121-6-22**] and underwent his preoperative evaluation, through
which echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55%.
He also underwent placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump
preoperatively on [**3121-6-24**].  Later that day he underwent a
coronary artery bypass grafting x 2 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery
and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, during which
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 75 minutes and cross-clamp
time was 45 minutes.  There was no note of intraoperative
complications.  The patient left the operating room on a
nitroglycerin and a propofol drip.  He was subsequently
extubated without difficulty.  He had his intra-aortic
balloon pump removed on postoperative day one while in the
cardiac surgery recovery unit.  He was also started on beta
blockade and aggressive diuresis.  Postoperatively it was
noted that he had fasting blood sugars of 200 to 300,
therefore [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 124**] diabetes consultation was obtained.  His
hemoglobin A1c was notably 11.3.  As per their
recommendations, the patient was started on b.i.d. dosing of
insulin and oral glucose control medications.  Nutrition was
also consulted to see the patient and he will follow up with
these services as an outpatient.  The patient was discharged
to the floor.  He was transferred to the floor from the
cardiac surgery recovery unit on postoperative day three,
where he continued his beta blockade and diuresis with Lasix.
His blood sugars were subsequently better controlled on the
floor, ranging in the 120s to 140s, and given that the
patient was able to ambulate without difficulty and complete
level 5 in terms of physical therapy, he was discharged to
home in good condition.

[**Last Name (STitle) 11647**] follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four weeks.  He
has multiple appointments for diabetes education and vision
care as an outpatient.

At the time of discharge his laboratory studies were as
follows:  His hematocrit was 26.8.  His BUN and creatinine
were 23 and 0.8 respectively with a potassium of 4.2.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 50 p.o. b.i.d.
2. Colace 100 p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.
3. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Percocet 5-325, 1-2 tablets p.o. q. 4 hours p.r.n.
6. Simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Pioglitazone 15 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Insulin NPH 18 units in the morning, 8 units before
bedtime.
10. Lasix was discontinued as the patient had returned to his
preoperative weight at the time of discharge.
