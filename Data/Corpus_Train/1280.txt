Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

ADDENDUM:

The patient was not discharged as previously planned on [**3-28**] due to a low hematocrit of 22.6, which we have
attributed to his hematuria which is resolving.  The patient
has been followed by the urology service and the patient
received 1 unit of packed cells yesterday evening the night
of [**3-28**].  His hematocrit this morning was 24.9.  He is
to receive one more unit of packed red blood cells today and
after his transfusion is completed, he may be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.  The transfusions are at the request
of the patient's primary care provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7856**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The
patient remains hemodynamically stable with no
contraindication to discharge from the hospital.  He is to
follow up with urology as previously discussed in one week
due to his hematuria and inability to spontaneously void.
