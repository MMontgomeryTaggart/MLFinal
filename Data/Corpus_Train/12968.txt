Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2556**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization.


History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year old man with past medical history significant
for coronary artery disease with multiple stents to LCx and LAD,
diabetes, hypertension, who was admitted two months ago for GI
bleed and NSTEMI and now presents from OSH with chest pain.
This morning, he was using stationary bicycle at home for less
than five minutes when he developed burning substernal chest
pain [**7-6**], similar in quality to previous ischemic episodes.
Took 3 nitros with minimal relief and decided to go to hospital.
 At [**Initials (NamePattern4) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2809**] Hospital ED, he was found to have TropI
5.02, BNP 2699; he was transferred by helicopter to [**Hospital1 68**] for
possible intervention.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 68**], T 99.9, HR 104, BP 150/68, RR 24, 96% on 3L
NC.  ECG notable for sinus tach with ST depression across
anterior precordium.  Initially pain free and plan was cath next
AM.  Patient then had return of chest pain with SBP in 80's.  No
change in EKG.  Taken to Cath lab emergently.
.
In cath lab [**8-18**]: LMCA was patent; LAD had 80% restenosis at
ostium; LCx had 100% in-stent restenosis.  DES was placed to L
main distal into the opening of LAD.  DES was also placed to
ostium/proximal LCx.  Right heart catheterization showed a wedge
pressure of 35.  PASP was 67. CI was 1.69.  He was transiently
on levophed and dopamine during the procedure and was
transferred from the cath to the CCU for further monitoring
.
Now in the CCU, patient denies lightheadedness; no palpitations.
 Now endorses CP [**2-3**], never fully disappeared during or after
cath.
.
Of note, he presented with CP in setting of GI bleed and NSTEMI
in [**3203-5-27**].  He had 100% occlusion of LCx stent; this was
balloon angioplastied.  There was also 70% occlusion of ostial
LAD; BMS was placed to this occlusion.

STUDIES:
.
EKG: NSR 100 with PACs.  RBBB with LAFB.  Diffuse ST-segment
depression in leads V1-V5.  TWI in I and aVL.
.
CORONARY CATHETERIZATION ([**3203-8-18**]):
1. Successful stenting of the ostial LAD restenosis with a
3.0x16mm
Taxus stent that was postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography
revealed no
residual stenosis, no angiogrpahically apparent dissection and
TIMI 3
flow (see PTCA comments).
2. Successful stenting of the ostial LCX restenosis with a
2.5x12mm
Taxus and a 3.0x8mm Taxus stents in overlapping fashion. Final
angiography revealed little residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow (see PTCA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful stenting of the LAD and LCX.
.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**3203-8-20**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25 %) with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis. The remaining
segments are hypokinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
RIGHT GROIN DOPPLER ULTRASOUND ([**3203-8-20**]):
FINDINGS: Views of the right groin demonstrate a patent common
femoral artery and common femoral vein with adequate
wall-to-wall flow. There is no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm,
hematoma, or arteriovenous fistula.
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND ([**3203-8-21**]):
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.5 cm and the left kidney
measures 11.3 cm. There is no hydronephrosis and no stones or
solid masses are identified in either kidney. A simple cyst is
seen in the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 3.6 x 4.4 x
3.2 cm.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Note is made that this is a limited study
due to the
patient's body habitus and the patient's ability to hold his
breath. Color
Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained. Arterial
waveforms of
the main renal arteries bilaterally demonstrate sharp upstrokes.
RIs of the
intraparenchymal arteries in the right kidney range from
0.69-0.80. RIs of
the intraparenchymal arteries of the left kidney range from
0.73-0.76.
Appropriate flow is seen in the main renal vein bilaterally.
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis and no renal stones identified. Simple
4.4-cm right
renal cyst.
2. Within the technical limits of the examination there is no
evidence of
renal artery stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is an 87 year old man with PMHx of CAD with
multiple stents most recently to proximal LAD and angioplasty of
ostial LCx in [**3203-5-27**] presents with exertional substernal
chest pain not responsive to nitrate, positive troponins, and
ST-segment depressions indicative of antero-lateral ischemia.
Now s/p PTCA and DES to LAD and LCx, admitted to the CCU for
closer monitoring.
..
# CAD/ISCHEMIA:  He went straight to the cath lab and had DES
placed to his left circumflex and left anterior descending
arteries.  Post-procedure, his chest pain gradually improved and
he was continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Integrillin.  The
Integrillin was stopped after 18 hours. During the rest of his
stay Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was continued on Aspirin, Plavix, Simvastatin and
a Beta Blocker.
..
# PUMP:  His most recent TTE at time of admission showed an LVEF
of 40% with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
consistent with coronary artery disease.  After the heart attack
and catheterization repeat echo showed EF of 30%.
Post-procedure, physical exam and oxygen requirements indicated
that he was slightly volume overloaded.  He was diuresed with IV
Lasix, then Lasix drip for about two days at which point his UOP
decreased and his creatinine began to rise.  The Lasix was
stopped he was kept even. His SBP remained in the mid 90s to
100s throughout his hospitalization.
.
As noted, he was continued on metoprolol and ACEI was held due
to acute renal failure.
..
# RHYTHM:  During this hospitalization he developed new atrial
fibrillation.  His ventricular rate was well controlled w/
metoprolol.  He was started on amiodorone with the goal to
convert him back to normal sinus rhythm.  Anticoagulation was
started with heparin and bridged to coumadin. At time of
discharge the patient was on 2.5 mg Coumadin daily and INR was
1.6, Heparin had been continued until discharge. The patient was
instructed to follow-up the day after discharge with his PCP,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], to follow his continued Warfarin monitoring and INR
checks with the therapeutic goal of [**12-29**] INR. The patient had
better controlled atrial fibrillation but was still having less
frequent, asymptomatic atrial fibrillation on telemetry with
evidence of fascicular block and bradycardia. He denied any
chest pain, palpitations, dizziness or shortness of breath at
the time of discharge. He will plan to continue rhythm control
with 200mg daily of Amiodarone. Given the patient's bradycardia
he will hold his beta blocker, Metoprolol, for now and he will
follow-up with his PCP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 771**] regarding restarting this
medication. He will continue telemonitoring on [**Hospital3 4683**]
with the services of local VNA.
..
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  He has chronic kidney disease
with a baseline creatinine of 1.4 to 1.7, elevated at time of
admission to 2.6 likely due to hypoperfusion in the setting of
NSTEMI and low-cardiac output.  He was treated pre and post-cath
with sodium bicarbonate and n-acetylcytsteine.  However, after
the procedure his creatinine continued to rise.  A renal
ultrasound was negative for obstruction or hydronephrosis.
Urine electrolytes were indicative of prerenal azotemia.  Urine
eosinophils were negative.  There were granular casts on
urinalysis which indicated ATN. A renal consult corroborated
this diagnosis.  His ACEI was held, as above, and his Is/Os were
kept even given the concern of hypovolemia and renal
hypoperfusion. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14281**] Cr eventually plateaud and began to
trend down and fortunately he did not need any dialysis
intervention. At time of discharge the patient's BUN was 92 and
Cr 3.2. The patient's baseline Cr is 1.7 range. The patient was
instructed to follow-up with a local nephrologist in [**Location (un) **] regarding a renal follow up over the coming 1-2 weeks
time. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Mr. [**Known patient lastname 14281**] PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] also continue to monitor
the patient's electrolytes and renal funtion as well. The
patient's Allopurinol dose was renally adjusted to 100mg daily.

..
# RIGHT AV FISTULA: This was seen on cardiac catheterization and
subsequently not seen on duplex ultrasound.  Vascular is
involved and he will need follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 163**] in 6 to
8 weeks.
..
# DM:  He was given a diabetic diet and insulin sliding scale.
..
# COPD:  We continued his home albuterol and ipratropium.
..
# GERD:  We continued his home PPI at twice daily dosing.
..
# GOUT:  We continued his home allopurinol at decreased dose due
to development of acute renal failure.
..
During the hospitalization, he was kept on a diabetic and
heart-healthy diet.  DVT prophylaxis was achieved first with
heparin subQ, and when he developed atrial fibrillation he was
started on heparin drip and bridged to warfarin.  GI
prophylaxis, as above, with PPI twice daily.  His code status
was full code throughout his hospital stay.

Discharge Instructions:
You had a heart attack with drug eluting stents to two coronary
arteries to repair a narrowing. Your kidneys were not working
very well so we adjusted your medicines. Your heart is weak so
you are on medicines to help it pump better (metoprolol and
captopril) You have a tendency to retain fluid so please weigh
yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) **] MD if weight > 3 lbs in 1 day or 6
pounds in 3 days.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet
Fluid Restriction: 2000cc
You have a heart rhythm irregularity called atrial fibrillation.
We are controlling your heart rate with metoprolol and
amiodarone and preventing strokes with coumadin. For now, please
do not take your Metoprolol until you follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 771**].
.
New medicines:
warfarin ( a blood thinner)
amiodarone( to slow your heart rate)
Metoprolol Succinate (a long acting medicine to slow your heart
rate)

Your usual Allopurinol dose was decreased to 100mg daily due to
your renal impairment. Please continue to take this dose until
your PCP informs you that your renal function is back to normal.


Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any chest pain, trouble
breathing, fluid accumulating in your arms or legs, a new cough
or nausea. For now, please do not take your Metoprolol until you
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 771**]. You may need to take some
