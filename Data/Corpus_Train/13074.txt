worked-up in the usual preoperative manner and found to be ready

room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four
vessels. Please see operative note for details. In summary he
had CABGx4 with LIMA-LAD, SVG-Daig, SVG-OM, SVG-Ramus. His
bypass time was 98 minutes with a crossclamp of 83 minutes. He
tolerated the operation well and postoperatively he was taken to
the intensive care unit for hemodynamic monitoring. He did well
in the immediate postoperative period. His anesthesia was
reversed and sedation stopped he was neurologically intact and
was extubated. On POD he remained hemodynamically stable and was
transferred to teh stepdown floor for continued care and
monitoring. Once on the floor his hospitalization was
uneventful, his Betablockers and diuretics were titrated, his
activity was advanced and on POD3 he was discharged home with
visiting nurses.
