History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 15661**] is a 83yo M with
history of CAD s/p RCA PCI in [**5-23**], dyslipidemia and CRI who
presents with sharp chest pain radiating to this back.
.
About two weeks PTA pt was diagnosed with pericarditis at [**Hospital1 68**]
ED.  At the time his ECG showed  slight diffuse ST elevation,
biomarkers were negative.  Denies having URI or flu like
symptoms prior to diagnosis of pericarditis.  Over the past
several days he has been experiencing worsening doe and chest
pain.  Pain is worse when sitting upright and is worse with
inspiration.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.4, 66, 127/80, 16, 97% RA.  He
had a bedside echo which showed pericardial effusion and
cardiology was consulted.  Formal echo was performed which
preliminarily showed early tamponade physiology with
invagination of RV.  His pulsus was in the high teens to low 20s
but he was hemodynamically stable.  Vitals on transfer to the
CCU were 67, 129/66, 24, 95% RA.
.
.
On floor vitals are 116/65, 86, 20 92% RA, with pulsus of
10hgmg.  Pt went into afib w/ rvr for several minutes and
converted to sinus spontaneously.  He was asymptomatic at the
time.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING
=================
ECHO [**10-3**]:
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. There is brief
right atrial diastolic collapse. There is right ventricular
diastolic compression, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3396-9-23**], the
pericardial effusion and tamponoade are new.

ECHO [**10-7**]:
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No residual pericardial effusion.

PROCEDURES:
==================
CARDIAC CATH:

COMMENTS:
1. Pericardiocentesis was performed with needle entry from the
subxiphoid position. The opening pericardial pressure was 20
mmHg.
2. Subsequent removal of 200 mL of pericardial fluid (all sent
for
studies) and confirmation by echocardiography of only a small
anterior
rim of pericardial fluid with the catheter positioned in the
anterior
pericardium. The pericardial pressure decreased to a mean of 7
mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pericardial tamponade with improvement in pericardial
pressure after
removal of 200 mL of straw colored fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 15661**] is a 83yo M with history of CAD s/p RCA PCI in
[**5-23**], CRI, recently diagnosed with pericarditis, who presented
with chest pain and worsening SOB and diagnosed with cardiac
tamponade.

# Pericardial Effusion/tamponade: Patient was diagnosed with
pericarditis 2 weeks prior to admission.  In the week leading to
admission patient had worsening SOB and DOE.  In the ED ECHO
showed early tamponade physiology with invagination of RV,
pulsus was 15-20 at that time.  Patient was given several large
fluid boluses with normalization of his puslus and started on
colchicine and prednisone.  A pericardial drain was placed with
serosanginous drainage which did not show malignant cells on
review by pathology.  The drain stayed in place for 4 days until
ECHO confirmed resolution of the effusion and the drain was
removed.  Patient's underlying inflammation was treated with
colchicine and high dose Aspirin for a 3 day course.  Omprezole
was added to the patient's medication list for gastric
protection while on aspirin 650 mg.
.
# RHYTHM:  Prior to drainage patient developed afib with RVR to
the 130s and frequent bradycardic episodes with rates in the 30s
that would spontaneously resolve.  He remained asymptomatic and
hemodyanmically stable during these episodes.  On the way to
pericardial drain placement patient had a 6 second conduction
pause with junctional escape suggesting an underlying
tachy-brady syndrome.  Subsequently post drainage patient
developed atrial flutter, EP was consulted and recommended an
ablation procedure which was successfully completed with return
to sinus rhythm.
.
# CKD: patient had baseline creatinine of 1.7 and elevated to
1.9 at presentation, likely secondary to poor renal perfusion.
He returned to baseline after pericardial drainage.
.
# Dislipidemia:  stable, patient continued on outpatient
regimen.
.
# Depression:  stable, patient was continued on outpatient
regimen.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Pericardial Effusion
Cardiac Tamponade
Atrial Flutter status post ablation


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to a collection of fluid
around your heart (pericardial effusion).  You had a drain
placed to drain the fluid around the heart.  You were placed on
medications to quell any inflammation and hopefully prevent
re-accumulation of the fluid around your heart.  Repeat imaging
of your heart showed no re-accumulation of fluid around your
heart after the drain was removed.  Sometimes aspirin can cause
irritation to the stomach and cause bleeding - if you develope
light headedness, dark black stools or blood in your stool, you
should call your physician or seek medical care.

You also developed an abnormal heart rhythm (atrial flutter)
during your admission.  You underwent an ablation to resolve
this and you had a normal heart rhythm on discharge.

You also had some wheezing during the admission - this may very
well be the sequelae to a viral infection that may have also
caused your pericarditis/effusion.  You have been given an
inhaler to use as needed for wheezing over the next few days.
If you have any shortness of breath or other concerning symptoms
you should see your physician or go to the emergency room.

You are being discharged home to follow-up with your outpatient
cardiologist in a few weeks.  You will need to take Aspirin for
the next 4 days and will need to be on colchicine for about 3
months - your outpatient cardiologist may decide to change this
plan at your follow-up appointment.

Changes in Medication:
- Start Aspirin 650mg three times a day through [**10-10**] - on [**10-11**]
return to 325 mg daily (your previous dose)
- Start Omeprazole 20 mg daily (protect your stomach while
taking aspirin)
- Start Colchicine 0.6 mg daily for 3 months
- Start Albulterol inhaler 1-2 puffs every 4-6h as needed for
shortness of breath or wheezing

- Please continue all other medications as previously prescribed

Followup Instructions:
Please call your outpatient cardiologist to arrange a follow-up
appointment.
