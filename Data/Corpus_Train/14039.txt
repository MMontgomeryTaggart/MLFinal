Brief Hospital Course:
Presented for cardiac catherization, was admitted post procedure
for preoperative workup.  On [**12-30**] he was brought to the
operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass graft,
mitral valve repair, and aortic valve replacement.  Please see
operative report for further details.  Received vancomycin for
periop antibiotics due to being in hospital preoperatively.  He
was transferred to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic
monitoring. Post operative chest radiograph revealed RLL
collapse and he was bronched for small amount of clots, but no
secretions.  In the first twenty four hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated without
complications.  He was started on betablockers and lasix for
gentle diuresis.  On postoperative day 2 he had atrial
fibrillation treated with beta blockers and amiodarone, which he
converted back to normal sinus rhythm.  Physical therapy worked
with him on strength and mobility.  He was transferred to the
floor post operative day three.  The patient remained in sinus
rhythm and was maintained on amiodarone.  He made good progress
with physical therapy.  The patient was found stable for
discharge on POD 5.
