LABORATORY DATA:   Pertinent laboratories on admission
included complete blood count with white blood cell count of
8.2, hematocrit 37.0, platelet count 200,000.  Chem7 showed a
sodium of 137, potassium 3.9, chloride 105, bicarbonate 26,
blood urea nitrogen 18, creatinine 0.9, blood sugar 131.
Prothrombin time 12.8, INR 1.1, partial thromboplastin time
25.8.  AST 26, ALT 26, alkaline phosphatase 72, total

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 65 year old gentleman came in for an
off pump coronary artery bypass graft times one with an
attempted thoracoscopic left internal mammary artery harvest.
The patient had his left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending placed.  The attending was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and he was assisted by nurse practitioner, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  In the operating room, the patient had an arterial
line and a Swan-Ganz catheter placed.  Following a brief stay
in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient was transferred
to the CSRU on a Propofol drip titrated to maintain sedation
while the patient was intubated.  On the evening of
postoperative day, the patient was extubated without any
difficulty and the patient was able to maintain his oxygen
saturation with nasal cannula oxygen.

On postoperative day number one, the patient had his chest
tube removed, was completely off all his Propofol drips and
was able to maintain oxygen saturation while staying in
normal sinus rhythm.  The patient was then transferred down
to the surgical floor for further recovery.  When the patient
reached the floor, the patient continued to have a good
recovery.  The only complication during his recovery was a
run of atrial fibrillation on postoperative day number two.
For the atrial fibrillation, the patient was placed on
intravenous Lopressor and following that he had an Amiodarone
bolus and drip.  The patient converted from atrial
fibrillation to sinus rhythm without any further incident and
the patient was maintained on Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. twice a
day.  The remainder of the patient's recovery was uneventful.
The patient had his wires pulled on postoperative day number
four.  The patient had been seen and evaluated by physical
therapy as soon as he reached the floor and their
recommendations were to send him home following a couple
therapy sessions with them.  By [**3293-1-11**], the patient and the
surgical team deemed that the patient was ready to be
discharged to home.

Physical examination on the day of discharge revealed the
patient was afebrile with temperature maximum 98.9, pulse 69
and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 116/62, respiratory rate 18
breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 93% in room air.
The patient was alert and oriented with no apparent distress.
The surgical site was clean, dry and intact with staples.
The patient was breathing evenly and unlabored.  His lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac examination
was regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 were noted.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended. Extremities - no
erythema and no edema.
