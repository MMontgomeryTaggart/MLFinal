CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Increased lethargy, decreased
responsiveness, question of a gastrointestinal bleeding,
hypotension, hypoxia.  This was a transfer from [**Hospital3 **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old white
male with a history of metastatic colon cancer, history of
lung, testicular and basal cell cancer, hypertension, history
of deep vein thrombosis, status post an ICD filter with
recurrent C. difficile colitis here with hypotension,
hypoxia, lethargy, "congestion", and unresponsiveness for two
days.  Got Levaquin yesterday and was transferred from
[**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation at [**Hospital1 470**].  The patient is usually alert and verbal
however, cannot do activities of daily living at baseline.
Chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 **] revealed a "mild bilateral
pneumonitis" and a 3 cm new right upper lobe nodule.  Today
increasing lethargy and no p.o. intake.  Was sent to [**Hospital1 1205**] for further evaluation ( on
route the patient decompensated with sats dropping to 80% on
room air and agonal breathing.  (In the Emergency Room the
temperature was 101.8, blood pressure 118/32, heart rate 101,
respiration rate of 20 and 98 to 100% on a non-rebreather).
The patient was intubated for respiratory failure.  Following
this blood pressures decreased to 78/34 responding to
intravenous fluid boluses back to a systolic blood pressure
of 110.  However, blood pressures decreased in the 80's and
the patient required to be started on Dopamine.  Got
Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, Protonix.  A right subclavian central
line was placed as well as an A-line.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Metastatic colon cancer.  Status post colectomy diagnosed
in [**3259**].
2.  Lung cancer diagnosed in [**3262**], status post left lower

orchiectomy.
4.  Basal cell carcinoma.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Bipolar disorder.
7.  Deep vein thrombosis.  Status post an IVC filter.
8.  Recurrent C. diff colitis however, a last C. diff was
    negative on [**3269-11-27**].
9.  A mild chronic renal insufficiency with creatinines
    ranging from 1.1 to 1.3.
10. Anemia with a baseline hematocrit of 26.
11. Sacral decubitus, status post a failed flap in [**3269-2-15**] with wound dehiscence.
12. Pseudo gout.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.8, heart rate 96,
blood pressure 117/53, O2 sats 86%  General:  Intubated,
sedated, cachectic and wasted appearing male.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Pinpoint pupils, poor dentition,
Entrotracheal tube in place.  Right subclavian in place.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac, regular, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops appreciated.  Lungs:  Generally clear to auscultation
bilaterally, decreased breath sounds at the right base.
Abdomen soft, slightly distended, normal active bowel sounds.
Rectal bag and Foley in place.  Extremities:  Right hip
Tegaderm, right heel ulcer, no edema.  Rectal:  Per the
Emergency Room, brown, OB positive stool.  Sacrum:  A deep,
approximately 6x6 open ulcer with necrotic bone exposed.

LABS:  White blood count 32.1, hematocrit 31.8, platelets 462
with a differential of 83 polys, 7 bands, 1 lymphocyte.  INR
of 1.9, sodium 147, potassium 5.2, chloride 110, bicarbonate
21, BUN 82, creatinine 3.2.  Glucose 170.  CK 46, Troponin
1.4.

Urinalysis revealed 1.025/5.5, small bili, trace leukocyte
esterase, nitrate negative, moderate blood, greater than 300
protein, trace ketones, white blood count greater than 50, 11
to 20 red blood cells, many bacteria, no yeast, no squamous
epi's.

Chest x-ray revealed an endotracheal tube in place, an
nasogastric tube in place, right subclavian tip in the
SVC/right atrial junction, no pneumothorax.  Bilateral
parenchymal opacities, possible effusion.  Arterial blood
gases:  7.06/68/337 on an SIMV 600 times 12 with 5 of PEEP
and 100% FIO2.

Electrocardiogram revealed left axis deviation, rate of 101
and normal sinus rhythm, question of a Q in lead 5, T-wave
inversions in Lead 1 and L.  Lactate was 1.5.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 81-year-old white male with a history
of metastatic colon cancer, lung cancer, history of
testicular basal cell cancer, hypertension, deep vein
thrombosis, status post an IVC filter, a recurrent C. diff
and a sacral decubitus here with sepsis likely from bilateral
aspiration pneumonia.  Urosepsis, question of osteo and
possible C. diff colitis.  The patient had low grade
temperature with an elevated white blood count.  Hypoxia
likely resulting in increase somnolence, change in mental
status.  He is also here in acute renal failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On arrival the patient was in hypoxic
respiratory distress and electively intubated.  Given
Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin, Flagyl and then Vancomycin
empirically.  Had copious guaiac positive green stools.  Got
three liters of intravenous fluid but required Dopamine to
maintain adequate pressures.  White blood count was 72 with
10% bands.  Stool returned C. diff positive and subsequently
was started on p.o. Vancomycin in addition to the intravenous
in order to treat this stubborn C. diff colitis.  Also as
cultures returned the patient was found to have Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, Klebsiella,
urosepsis and 1/4 bottles with gram negative diplococci that
was likely a contaminant.

His urine output continued to fall and renal was consulted
and he was determined to have oliguric ATN, likely secondary
to hypoperfusion.  He also had a metabolic acidosis which was
likely multi-factorial and secondary to his diarrhea, lactic
acidosis and uremia.  Treatment with bicarbonate was
initiated.  Because he had become hyponatremic, free water
boluses were initiated.

The patient had a TTE revealing an EF of 40 to 50%, left
atrium mildly dilated, no Arteriosclerotic disease, anterior
septum and anterior free wall may be slightly more
hypokinetic.

Plastic Surgery was consulted about possible vacuum dressing
to the severe sacral decubitus however, they recommended
supportive care as it was operatively unable to fix and
vacuum dressing was not indicated.
After five days Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] had not responded to antibiotics
and was still intubated requiring pressors.  Several days of
discussion with both daughters had occurred and they were
updated on his poor prognosis.  On day five admission they
decided to change the focus of his care to comfort and to
stop aggressive measures.  The patient passed away on [**3269-12-22**]
at 4:40 AM.
