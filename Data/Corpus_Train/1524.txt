TWO VIEW CHEST X-RAY [**2618-1-6**]:
COMPARISON: Deceember 11, [**2617**].
INDICATION: Status post esophagectomy.
IMPRESSION: Stable postoperative appearance of mediastinum.
Improving multifocal pulmonary opacities.
BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT
Reason: please evaluate follow-through of barium from
oral-pharynx t
COMPARISON: Upper GI study of [**2617-8-11**].
LIMITED SINGLE CONTRAST UPPER GI STUDY: Contrast passes freely
down the remaining esophagus and gastric pull-up. Trace
aspiration was noted. Adjacent to the site of the drain, there
is appears to be a focal area of contrast extravasation. There
is delayed and slow emptying of contrast from the stomach.
Barium was administered through the J- tube which demonstrated
filling of the jejunal loops. The patient vomited approximately
150 cc of barium and the study was terminated due to patient
intolerance.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild aspiration.
2. Focal contrast extravasation at the site of the leftsided
drain.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

PORTABLE CHEST, [**2618-1-7**]
COMPARISON: [**2618-1-6**].
INDICATION: Status post EGD procedure. Evaluate for
pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
Postoperative changes are noted in the mediastinum following
esophagectomy and pull-up procedure. There remains asymmetrical
perihilar haziness on the right as well as a moderate-sized
right pleural effusion. Minor atelectatic changes are seen
within the left lung base, also without interval change.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
