LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White blood count 12.4, hg 12.6, hematocrit 35.3, platelet
count 224,000.  PT 13.4, PTT 20.6, INR 1.3, fibrinogen 289,
sodium 140, potassium 3.5, chloride 103, BUN 16, creatinine
1.0, glucose 167, amylase 40, urinalysis negative, lactate
was 3.8, serum toxicology negative, urine toxicology
negative.  ABG:  PO 257, pCO 32, pH 7.43, total CO2 22, base
deficit -1.  Of note:  Sample was venous sample.  Free
calcium of 1.2.  Calculated hematocrit 41.

Radiographic studies:  Left shoulder x-ray showed a left
clavicular fracture.  Right hip x-ray negative.  Right femur
x-ray shows a right femur fracture, angular and displaced.
C-spine x-ray shows C1 to C2 subluxation, question of
atlantoaxial subluxation, no fractures.  Pelvis x-ray:  No
fractures or dislocations.  TL spine series:  No fractures or
dislocations.  Chest x-ray shows a widened mediastinum.  CTG
of the chest showed a sternal fracture, right rib fractures,
right fourth rib fracture.  No pneumothorax.  No hemothorax,
no aortic dissection.  CT of the abdomen shows a low
attenuation in the left lower lobe of the liver, consistent
with either contusion or hemangioma.  CT of the head was
negative.  CT of the C-spine shows a C1-C2 atlantooccipital
subluxation, no fractures.

The patient was consulted with Orthopedic Surgery on the
25th.  The patient had a left posterior hip dislocation
reduced by the Department of Orthopedics.  On the same day,
the patient also had a right femoral IM rod placed
successfully for left clavicular fracture.  No further work
was necessary per Orthopedic Department.  The patient only to
be maintained in sling.

Regarding sternal fractures and right 4th rib fracture, no
further work to be done per Orthopedic Surgery.

The patient was made NPO on the evening of the 25th to have a
four vessel angiogram to be performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Given
the C1-C2 subluxation, question of carotid vessel compromise.
In the meantime, the patient was put on neck traction to
reduce the C1-C2.  Four-vessel angiograms results were
negative for any extravasation, bleed, or vessel deformity.

After approximately 24 hours, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 478**] with Orthopedic Surgery
spinal consultation recommendation a CT scan of C1-C2 with
maximal leftward rotation and maximal rightward rotation with
thin-cuts to be performed on the patient to reassess the
patient's C1-C2 instability.  Films were reviewed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 478**].
In the meantime, C-collar was maintained on the patient.
Traction was taken off on the 26th.  Results of the C spine
shows a fixed C1-C2 subluxation upon rotational views.
Dr.  [**First Name (STitle) 478**] noted that the patient could be cleared from the
cervical spine on the [**11-18**].  Therefore, the
patient's hard collar could be discontinued and taken off.

The day, prior to discharge, the patient was switched to PO
pain medications, PCA pump.  The patient was maintained on
Lovenox subcutaneously.  The Department of Orthopedics
recommended that the patient be weightbearing as tolerated on
the right lower extremity.  The patient was tolerating POs
well up to the day of discharge.  The patient had no other
further complications prior to discharge.  The patient is to
be discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Facility today on
[**9-19**].  The patient is to continue PT therapy,
outpatient full weightbearing as tolerated on the right lower
extremity, maintain the left shoulder sling.  The patient is
cleared C-spine clinically, therefore, the patient does not
need a cervical collar.  The patient is follow up with the
orthopedic clinic with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5180**] [**Name (STitle) 478**], approximately 7 days
to 10 days after discharge.  Telephone #:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) **].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Good.  The patient will be discharged to
[**Hospital3 **] Facility.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Status post right femur fracture with open
reduction and internal fixation, right femoral rod; right
fourth rib fracture, sternal fracture, left clavicular
fracture, C1-C2 subluxation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d.
2.  Percocet 5/325 one tablet to two tablets PO q.4h. to
6h.p.r.n. pain.

The patient is to need physical therapy services, full
weightbearing as tolerated on right lower extremity.  The
patient is to use crutches if needed.  The patient was
instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5180**] [**Name (STitle) 478**] in the
orthopedic spine clinic within 7 days to 10 days after
discharge.  Phone:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 701**].  The rehabilitation
facility is advised to schedule the appointment on the
patient's behalf.
