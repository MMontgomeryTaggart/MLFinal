Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19314**]
Chief Complaint:
Feeling unwell, Hypertensive urgency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
dialysis


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 22 yo female with Lupus, end-stage renal disease on HD,
HTN, multiple other medical problems as below who presents with
feeling unwell and found to be in hypertensive urgency. Pt
states that last Thursday, five days ago, she started to feel
unwell. States that she had chills, no fever, a "weird feeling
in my stomach" with cramps, and no cough. No diarrhea. No
dysuria. Pt missed her dialysis session on Saturday because she
was feeling unwell (3 days ago). Per patient she started to feel
better that day, but today, started to feel unwell with the same
symptoms. No sick contacts.
.
In the ED, VS on arrival were: HR: 73; BP: 222/128, 100% RA. She
was given labetalol 20 mg IV, 40 mg IV, and then started on a
labetaolol gtt.She was also calcium gluconate 1 am IV,
kayexalate 30 mg po x 1, 10 units of insulin IV, and 1 amp of
d50.
.
Of note, pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] at the end of [**Month (only) 626**] for
Left uveitis/endophthalmitis. She the developed [**Female First Name (un) 498**]
endophthalmitis and had her L eye enucleation. She states that
she went to her appt at [**Hospital **] 5 days ago. They said
that her eye "looked good" and she was to continue on the same
amount of prednisone that she is on.
.
Her last admission she was also noted to have coag negative
staph bacteremia. She was discharged on 14 day course of
vancomycin but she somehow did not receive this at dialysis. She
has now had 4 sets bld cx + for coag negative staph and was
started on vancomycin.

Past Medical History:
1. Lupus - [**3346**]. Diagnosed after she began to have swolen
fingers, a rash and painful joints.
2. ESRD secodary to SLE - [**3347**]. Was initially on cytoxan, 1 dose

every 3 months for 2 years until began dialysis 3 times a week

mother.
3. HTN - [**3349**]. Normal BPs run 180's/120's. Has had 1
hypertensive crisis that precipitated seizures in the past.
4. Uveitis secondary to SLE - [**3-16**]
5. HOCM - per Echo in [**3349**]
6. Vaginal bleeding [**3352-8-20**]
7. Mulitple episodes of dialysis reactions
8. Anemia
9. Coag neg. Staph bacteremia and HD line infection - [**5-16**]
10. H/O UE clot, was on coumadin, but no longer

.
Ecchocardiogram: Severe symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%.
Moderate resting LVOT gradient. LVOT gradient increases with
Valsalva.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. No 2D or Doppler evidence
of distal arch coarctation.  AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve
leaflets (3). Trace AR.  MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve
leaflets with trivial MR. No MVP.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Echocardiographic results were reviewed with
the
houseofficer caring for the patient.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and dynamic systolic
function (LVEF>80%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. There is a moderate (25mmHg peak) resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction that increased (64mmHg)
with the Valsalva manuever. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Marked symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
dynamic
systolic function and resting LVOT gradient that increased with
Valsalva.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3350-11-4**],
the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy has increased and
trace aortic regurgitation is now identified. Dynamic LV
systolic function and the resting intracavitary gradient are
similar.
.
UE ultrasound
1.  Abrupt occlusion of the right internal jugular vein and its
distal most aspect as it joins with the distal subclavian vein.
2.  Recanalization of the left subclavian vein with some
peripheral residual clot.  Recommend analysis of the SVC,
central subclavians and internal jugular veins with dedicated
magnetic resonance venography, which can be performed without
intravenous contrast for a global assessment of the venous
patency.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 22 yo female with SLE, ESRD on HD, amongst other
problems who presented with symptoms likely [**1-12**] bacteremia.
Found to be in hypertensive urgency after missing a run of
dialysis. She is now transferred to the floor for further
managment after dialysis x 1 and starting vancomycin.
.
In the MICU she was started kept briely on a labetalol gtt, and
then restarted on her home antihypertensives and dialyzed x 1
with resolution of hypertension. She was found to be bacteremic
and was started on vancomycin. She felt well and was transferred
to the floor.
.
1. Hypertensive urgency- Pt with long history of very
difficult-to-control HTN. She was initially on a labetalol gtt
as above, was dialyzed with resolution of her HTN urgency.  She
was then transitioned to her her outpatient medication regimen
of valsartan, lisinopril, clonidine, labetalol, terazosin, and
nicardipine at max doses, but because of persistent HTN to the
180's she was started on hydralazine 50mg po tid on discharge.
.
2. Coag negative staph bacteremia: most likely source is line
sepsis.  She was started on vancomycin and her blood cultures
cleared after 2 days in the hospital.  The patient felt strongly
about keeping her HD line, which was felt to be reasonable
because her infection was coag negative staph.  Ecchocardiogram
did not show any valvular vegitations.  She will continue on
vancomycin for 3 weeks at hemodialysis.
.
3. ESRD on dialysis-euvolemic clinically.  Had dialysis inhouse.
 Continued sevelamer.
.
4. Left uveitis/endopthalmitis-Continued prednisone 30 mg po
qday. Will also continue bacitracin-polymyxin b.
.
5. Lupus- not on any other medications than above.
.
F/E/N- insists on regular diet
