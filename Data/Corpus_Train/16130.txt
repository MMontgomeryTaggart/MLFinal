Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1725**]
Chief Complaint:
left hip fracture noted at [**Hospital1 **] s/p mechanical fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Hemiarthroplasty


History of Present Illness:
74 yo female with who presented to [**Hospital1 **] s/p fall, found to
have left subcapital fracture by CT of hip, transferred to [**Hospital1 68**]
for further management.

She initally was in an MVA last year when it was noted that she
had a AAA on CXR. She then had an elective Thoracoabdominal
aortic aneurysm resection/repair with hospital course c/b
post-op respiratory failure, recurrent Afib, multiple
bronchs, L sided lung collapse, trach on [**3433-1-31**] after failed
extubation of [**3433-1-28**].  Trach was removed at Rehab, however she
was readmitted in [**2-16**] with slight hyperfunction of false vocal
cords, bilateral vocal cord immobility with ~1mm glottic gap
requiring trach placement on [**3433-3-12**].

Pt was walking with her walker when she tripped on the carpet
and fell onto her left L hip hitting her head at home.  Denies
LOC, HA, neck pain, CP, SOB, weakness, LH. Assisted to bed, able
to bear wt for 2 steps. Pain localized to medial thigh with
movement of LLE. Was brought to [**Hospital1 **], initially XRay
unrevealing, CT though showed fx of L hip. Ortho evaluated in
ED, plan to perform ORIF during this admit after risk
stratified; NWB on L, no traction indicated, anticoagulate.
Given extensive comorbidities, she was admitted to Medicine for
periop management.

Past Medical History:
1. Thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm, repair [**1-19**], c/b resp
failure and trach.
2. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis, s/p repeat trach [**3-19**].
3. Clostridium difficile positivity.
4. VRE positivity.
5. Postoperative atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion.
6. Hypertension.
7. Type 2 diabetes.
8. Osteoarthritis.
9. Lower back pain.
10. Hypercholesterolemia.
11. Left Breast Cancer - s/p lumpectomy
12. Atrial fibrillation - this was first noted post op from the
AAA repair. She was started on a BB and amio at that time then
DCCV. She has not been on coumadin.
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
-Thoracic/abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, [**3433-1-15**].

Social History:

fracture. Her husband and daughter involved in her care.  No
tob, etoh, other drugs. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 211**] Globe reporter has been

CXR [**8-30**]:
Cardiomegaly unchanged. The aorta is very tortuous and dilated
as seen previously. There are postoperative changes in the left
hemithorax with rib fractures/ressections, which is unchanged
when compared to prior study. There is again noted a left
retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm, which
is improved when compared to the prior study likely representing
atelectasis or scarring. The right lung is grossly clear. The
patient is status post tracheostomy. Tracheostomy tube appears
to be in appropriate position. In the left upper quadrant, there
are metallic wires and surgical clips. There is mild S-shaped
scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine with some mild dextroconvex
thoracic component and levoconvex lumbar component. No evidence
of pneumothorax. There is mild upper zone redistribution of the
pulmonary vascularity, which could represent mild CHF. There are
degenerative changes of the sternoclavicular joints bilaterally.

HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT  [**8-30**]:
Unusual small lucency involving the medial cortex of the left
proximal femur without clear fracture line identified.

Knee film [**9-1**]:
The alignment appears normal. There are some mild degenerative
changes. No fracture is identified.

Echo [**9-2**]:
Normal regional with low normal left ventricular systolic
function. Dilated ascending aorta. Mild-moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  Compared with the prior study
(tape reviewed) of [**3433-1-17**], the ascending aorta is minimally more
dilated. Global left ventricular systolic function is similar.

Micro: [**9-5**] sputum grew PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA and ESCHERICHIA
COLI, both pan-sensitive.
VRE and MRSA screens were negative here. Has had a h/o of this
in the past.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo F s/p fall, found to have left subcapital hip fracture by
CT, admitted to medical service for risk stratification prior to
ORIF. She then had resp failure following ORIF requiring MICU
stay for diuresis and suctioning. She was transferred to the
floor and has been recovering well.

#) Left Hip Fx. She was kept non weight bearing until Left
hemiarthroplasty on [**9-3**].  She has multiple cardiac risk factors
making her intermediate risk and could achieve at least 4 mets
prior to recent surgery. She had a normal perfusion on a
Persantine MIBI preop in [**1-19**] at [**Hospital 18**] Hosp. A pre-op echo was
preformed on [**9-2**] revealing normal regional wall motion with low
normal left ventricular systolic function and mild-moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  When compared with the
prior study of [**3433-1-17**], the ascending aorta is minimally more
dilated with similar global left ventricular systolic function.
She received aggressive pulmonary toilet (chest PT, incentive
spirometry, encourage coughing) prior to surgery to maximize her
lung function.  Her pain was well controlled with acetaminophen
1000mg q6h and oxycodone 5mg Q4H PRN prior to surgery. The
cemented left unipolar hip hemiarthroplasty was done on [**9-3**]
without complications. She was transfused 2 units of blood for
post-op anemia. She received Lovenox SC BID for prophylaxis.
She should remain on this until she has adequate activity. On
discharge her wound was without evidence of infection and had
some serous drainage.

#) Post-op Hypoxemia - After the hip surgery, she was
persistently and progressively hypoxemic and was requiring
increasing suctioning. She was transferred to the MICU on [**9-4**].
Her MICU course was significant for low grade temps and
increased sputum production. She was started on empiric Zosyn
and Vanco for hospital-acquired PNA. Her O2 sats gradually
improved and she made less secretions. In rehab, she will
continue to need suctioning and incentive spirometry as well as
to continue Zosyn/Vanc for a total of 7 days, ending on [**9-14**].
Her sputum culture grew pseudomonas (pansensitive), e.coli
(pansensitive), and staph aureus (MRSA).
.
#) Pain management: She hallucinations with the IV Dilaudid
given to her for her post-op pain. Therefore, her post op pain
was controlled with Tylenol 1 gm q6 hrs and oxycodone 5 mg po
prn. She also has chronic abdominal pain from her AAA surgery
since [**Month (only) 1702**]. The pain service was consulted who recommended
starting neurontin 600 mg qhs. This should be titrated as
tolerated.  Neurontin is for chronic pain from thoracoabdominal
aneurysm repair. At discharge, the Neurontin was controlling her
pain somewhat.
.
#) CAD (no known CAD though multiple cardiac risk factors
including age, DM, HTN). She had a normal stress test at [**Location (un) 18**]
prior to aneurysm repair.
She was continued on ASA 81mg qd, Simvastatin 10mg daily, and
Metoprolol.
.
#) Mild dystolic disfunction.  She was on lasix QOD prior to
admission. This was not restarted at present, but if she
continues to require large amounts of TM O2, then consider
restarting.
.
#) AFIB: h/o postoperative atrial fibrillation requiring
cardioversion in [**1-19**]. She was in NSR and well rate controlled
with Amiodarone 400 daily and Metoprolol. She will f/u with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 265**] as an outpatient about this. She will likely need
coumadin once she is no longer on Lovenox.
.
#) Trach care: She takes Guaifenesin prn, Atrovent neb prn, and
needs aggressive pulm toilet. Scheduled outpt pulm f/u. She also
needs ENT f/u (?h/o laryngeal dysfunction)
.
#) Type 2 diabetes: She was on Avandia 4mg daily prior to the
surgery. However, she has bot been requiring insulin here on a
RISS. She also has not been eating much. She may need to start
the Avandia again in the future as she eats more.

#) GERD: She is on Protonix 40 daily.

#) Insomnia: We continued her on outpatient dose of Ativan 0.5mg
qhs:prn

#) Depression: Celexa 40mg qd. Her mood was hopeful on
discharge.
