The patient did not have his dosages with him at the time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was in sinus rhythm in the 70s with
a pressure of 115/82 on the right and 146/82 on the left.  He
was 6'0" at 153 pounds.  He had venostasis changes in
bilateral lower extremities right worse then left.  He
appeared to be well hydrated.  He had no thyromegaly or JVD.
No tracheal deviation and no carotid bruits.  His left
carotid endarterectomy scar appeared to be healing well.  His
lungs were clear bilaterally with breath sounds decreased mid
and lower right chest without any wheezing or rhonchi.  Heart
was regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2.  No murmurs or
rubs.  His abdominal examination was benign.  His extremities
were warm.  He had point tenderness on both feet with
venostasis color changes in bilateral lower extremities.  He
also had varicosities in his right leg.  His neurological
examination was grossly intact.  He had some difficulty
walking due to his peripheral vascular disease and uses a
cane.  He had good capillary refill in both legs with no calf
tenderness.  The patient was noted to be right handed and had
poor collateral ulnar flows demonstrated right ____________
mammography.

His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with lateral
ST and T wave changes.  The patient had a chest CT without
contrast done on [**2-12**] preoperatively for a right apical
opacity on his preop chest x-ray.  Of note, was emphysema and
two small calcified nodules in the right lung apex.  In
addition, there was another noncalcified nodule in the
periphery of the left upper lobe.  In addition, bilateral
proximal renal artery calcifications were seen as well as a
hyperdense liver and evidence of emphysema.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 9.1,
hematocrit 42.8, PT 12.4, PTT 29.4, platelets count 239,000,
INR 1.0, sodium 139, K 4.0, chloride 98, CO2 28, BUN 14,
creatinine 0.8 with a blood sugar of 72 and anion gap of 17,
ALT 19, AST 21, LDH 197, alkaline phosphatase 66 and total
bili of 0.6.  Preoperative chest x-ray prior to his chest CT
showed linear opacities previously noted peripherally in the
right upper lobe.  In addition, coronary artery
calcifications were noted as well as degenerative changes of
the spine.  Please refer to this chest CT done in early
[**Month (only) 354**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2-16**] the patient underwent a
coronary artery bypass grafting times three by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1882**] with a left internal mammary coronary artery to the left
anterior descending coronary artery, vein graft to obtuse
marginal and vein graft to the posterior descending coronary
artery.  The patient was transferred to the cardiothoracic
ICU on a neo-synephrine drip at 1 microgram per kilogram per
minute, Propofol drip at 30.  Later that afternoon the
patient was reopened for bleeding by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  There
was some bleeding from the left internal mammary harvest site
as well as right sternum with a generalized ooze.  On
postoperative day one the patient had been extubated.  He had
no dopplerable peripheral pulses.  The patient desated
slightly on a 60% face maxed, but improved to 96%.  He had
coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  His sternum was stable.
His postop hematocrit was 26.5.  His BUN was 7, creatinine
0.6 and a potassium of 4.2.  He was receiving Percocet prn
and Ativan for presumed ETOH withdraw.  He was on no drips at
the time.  He was seen by psychiatry for follow up who
recommended giving him Ativan as well as thiamine and folate.
On postoperative day two he was a bit agitated overnight and
was treated by additional Ativan prn as well as Haldol.  He
was somewhat hypertensive and tachycardic in the morning with
a heart rate of 112 and a blood pressure of 151/78, but he
was alert, but unable to follow commands and trying to pull
his oxygen mask off.  His hematocrit on that morning was
31.4.  His other laboratories were unremarkable.  The
diagnosis was just delirium and acute agitation to be treated
with continuing Haldol and Ativan.

On postoperative day two he was transfused 2 units of packed
red blood cells.  His Swan was discontinued.  His Ativan was
decreased per psychiatry.  His neo was weaned off.  His
Lopresor was added in.  He was in sinus rhythm at 102 with a
blood pressure of 157/76.  His sternum was stable.  His
hematocrit was 29.5.  He continued with advancing his diet
and pulmonary toilet.  Postoperative day three he was started
on an alcohol drip and was restarted on Captopril added into
his Lopresor and he started receiving some tube feeds,
completed his perioperative antibiotics.  Later that day his
alcohol drip was held and then restarted at approximately one
third of the dose.  He was seen by clinical nutrition for
assessment of his appropriate tube feeds.  He was also seen
by physical therapy and continued to be followed by
psychiatry.  On postoperative day four he received Lasix and
Diamox.  His alcohol drip was being held.  He was in sinus
rhythm in the 90s with a good blood pressure sating 96% on 4
liters nasal cannula.  His hematocrit stabilized at 30.2 and
he continued to have his blood pressure medications adjusted
with Captopril and Lopressor for tighter blood pressure
control.  On postoperative day five his alcohol drip was back
on.  He was tachycardic in the low 100s, sating 94% on room
air.  His hematocrit rose to 33.4.  His other laboratories
were unremarkable.  His Lopressor was increased to bring his
heart rate down.  His diet was advanced.

On postoperative day six he continued on his alcohol drip in
sinus rhythm. His hematocrit continued to improve to 37.0,
as he continued to stabilize on the unit on his alcohol drip.
On the [**2-22**] he was transferred to the floor.  His
Foley, wires and chest tubes had been discontinued in the
Intensive Care Unit.  He was alert, oriented and cooperative.
 Pedal pulses were being monitored carefully for peripheral
circulation.  He was sating 97% on room air.  His breath
sounds were clear.  On postoperative day seven he had no
issues overnight and he was ambulating on his own without any
difficulty except he was interrupted by some claudication
pain in his legs, which was his baseline.  His lungs were
clear.  Sternal incision was healing nicely.  His abdominal
examination was unremarkable.  He had minimal lower extremity
edema.  He was doing well and almost ready for discharge
pending his final physical therapy evaluation with the plan
that he will be able to go home.  He was seen by case
management and followed up by the clinical nutrition team.
He remained in sinus rhythm with no ectopy and was ambulating
on his own with a cane.  On [**2-24**] he was discharged to
home with instructions to return on [**3-3**] for an
incision check and to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1882**] in
approximately two to four weeks in the office.  He was also
instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 24123**] his
cardiologist in approximately one week and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 24124**]
in approximately one to two weeks his primary care physician.
