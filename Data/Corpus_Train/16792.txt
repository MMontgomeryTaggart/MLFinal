CT head [**3271-8-13**]:
Limited study secondary to motion artifact. No definite evidence
of acute infarct.

Carotic catheterization [**3271-8-13**]:
Carotid/vertebral arteries:  The RCCA is normal.  The [**Country 313**] has a

focal 99% lesion after bifurcation with the ECA.  The ICA filled
the
ipsilateral ACA and MCA with cross filling of the contralateral
ACA.
The vertebral artery was patent. Successful stenting of the [**Country 313**]
was performed with a 8.0 x 30 mm. Precise stent, complicated by
slurring of speech and LLE weakness that improved but did not
resolve by the end of the case.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Critical [**Country 313**] disease.
2. Stenting of the [**Country 313**] complicated by CVA.



Brief Hospital Course:
Following the catheterization procedure, the patient was
transferred to CCU.

1. s/p TIA - The patient had a head CT done which did not reveal
any evidence of acute stroke. The patient was observed closely
overnight. She did well overninght and her symptoms completely
resolved. The patient was seen and evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6053**] from
Neurology. In the CCU, the patient was started on Phenyephrine
drip for blood pressure control and the rate was titirateed to
keep left arm cuff systolic blood pressure 130 to 160. All her
home blood pressure meds were held. She was slowly weaned off
Phenylephrine drip. She received several 500 cc bolus of NS to
help keep her systolic blood pressure above 130. She was
discharged without her BP meds and was instructed to have her BP
checked in 3 days at Dr.[**Name (NI) 7036**] office and to consult Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]/or Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding whether she should resume her BP
medications.

2. CAD  - She was continued on ASA, Plavix, lipitor. Her last
coumadin dose was on [**3271-8-10**]. The decision was made not to
resume her on coumadin.

3. PPX - while hospitalized she was started on bowel regimen,
pneumoboots for DVT prevention, and received cardiac low fat
diet.

4. Disposion - The patient was discharged [**Last Name (un) **] on ASA, plavix,
lipitor. She will consult Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**8-17**] regarding
restarting Atenolol, Lisinopril/Hctz, Imdur, Lasix, Digoxin. She
has BP machine at home and will be checking her BP as well. She
known that her goal is SBP >130 but not higher than 150 as she
had a recent TIA. Coumadin was stopped. The patient will follow
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**10-27**] and will have carotid US done
on the same day. The patient was warned about symptoms of
TIA/CVA and heart failure and was instructed to call her
physican or go to the emergency room if necessary. On the day of
discharge, she was able to ambulate without any problems.
