HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60 year old male who
is status post fall and was being worked up for rotator cuff
repair when he had an abnormal electrocardiogram.  He has a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diet
controlled diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol and
pericarditis.  He had an exercise treadmill test on [**2871-5-20**],
which was negative for chest pain but revealed moderate to
severe anterior apical ischemia with an ejection fraction of
54%.  He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2871-5-21**], which
showed left main short nonobstructive, nonobstructive left
anterior descending, heavily obstructed proximal 60%, distal
100% occluded, filled by bridging collaterals, left
circumflex midsection 50% stenosed, right coronary artery
proximal 50% stenosed, left ventricular ejection fraction of
55% with no mitral regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
3.  High cholesterol.
4.  Pericarditis.
5.  Back surgery.
6.  Carpal tunnel surgery.
7.  Transurethral resection of prostate.
8.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Ecotrin.
2.  Lopressor.
3.  Lisinopril.
4.  Atorvastatin.
5.  Zantac.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine which causes nausea and vomiting.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is an ex-smoker and quit 33
years ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.  He
has two brothers who both have had coronary artery bypass
grafts.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, the patient is alert and
oriented in no acute distress.  His neurologic examination is
grossly intact.  No carotid bruits noted.  Pulmonary - The
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac -
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs noted.  The abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities - Cool feet,
positive dorsalis pedis and popliteal pulses bilaterally.  No
edema and no varicosities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2871-5-21**], and
taken to the operating room on [**2871-5-22**], where coronary
artery bypass graft times three was performed.
Postoperatively, the patient required Propofol and
Neo-Synephrine drip.  He left the operating room as well with
chest tubes and pacing wires in place.  He received four
doses of perioperative Vancomycin as antimicrobial
prophylaxis.  The patient initially did quite well and was
started on his postoperative medications of Lopressor and
Lasix.  His diet was advanced successfully.  His drips were
eventually weaned.  His chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed at the appropriate time.  The patient was initially
going to leave the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day
number one but once he arrived to the floor, the patient had
an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.  He received 8 mg of
Lopressor which caused his blood pressure to drop
precipitously.  He was then transferred back to the Intensive
Care Unit where he required a Neo-Synephrine drip again and
close observation.  The patient subsequently did well and he
was started on Amiodarone and continued on his Lopressor.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient required a unit
of packed red blood cells for acute anemia.  When the patient
was adequately stable, he was transferred to the regular
cardiothoracic floor where he continued to do well.  He was
seen by physical therapy who were happy with his progress and
eventually cleared him to go home without continuing physical
therapy.  The patient was also seen by the Electrophysiology
team regarding his rapid atrial fibrillation.  They made
recommendations for anticoagulation and continued Lopressor
and Amiodarone treatment.  Over the next couple days, the
patient continued to have short bursts of rapid atrial
fibrillation that would spontaneously break within
approximately two minutes.  Finally on [**2871-5-30**], the patient
had another episode of rapid atrial fibrillation although
this episode did not break quickly.  He required 10 mg of
Lopressor and 150 mg of intravenous Amiodarone bolus to break
the episode.  Electrophysiology again was notified and they
recommended Lopressor 100 mg twice a day, Amiodarone 400 mg
twice a day times five days, Amiodarone 400 mg once daily
thereafter with follow-up in a couple weeks.  They also
recommended [**Doctor Last Name 852**] of Hearts for discharge.  They did indicate
that the patient would be safe for discharge.

It is now [**2871-5-30**], and the patient is ready for discharge.
He will likely go home in the morning on [**2871-5-31**], once INR
monitoring and [**Doctor Last Name 852**] of Hearts are organized.  The patient
will be discharged in good condition.

FOLLOW-UP:  He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four
weeks.  He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] in two weeks and
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2092**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6556**] in one to two weeks.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lopressor 100 mg twice a day.
2.  Amiodarone 400 mg twice a day times five days and then
once daily.
3.  Coumadin dose daily per recommendations of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2092**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6556**] after daily INR checks.
4.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n. pain.
5.  Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. twice a day.
7.  Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day p.r.n.

The patient may shower but should not take baths.  The
patient should not drive while on pain medication.  The
patient should avoid strenuous activity.
