HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old white
male patient with a known history of aortic regurgitation
which has been followed over the past few years by serial
echocardiography.  The most recent one showed worsening
aortic regurgitation and the patient was referred for aortic
valve replacement.  The patient had a cardiac catheterization
which revealed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction,
normal coronary arteries, and severe aortic regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortic regurgitation, per HPI.
2.  GERD.
3.  Intermittent hematuria with negative cystoscopy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Wisdom teeth extraction.
2.  Skin lesion removal.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Ibuprofen p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, unknown reaction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Unremarkable.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The preoperative laboratory
values were unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2881-3-19**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1882**] where he underwent a
limited access aortic valve replacement with a #29
[**Last Name (un) 1768**]-[**Doctor Last Name 529**] pericardial valve.  Postoperatively, he
was transported from the operating room to the cardiac
surgery recovery unit in good condition.

On the day of surgery, he was weaned from mechanical
ventilation and extubated.  On postoperative day number one,
he remained hemodynamically stable and his chest tube/[**Doctor Last Name 890**]
drain was discontinued and he was transferred from the
Intensive Care Unit to the telemetry floor, at which point
the patient began to progress with physical therapy and
ambulation and cardiac rehabilitation.

Today, postoperative day number two, the patient remains
hemodynamically stable.  His epicardial pacing wires were
removed this morning.  He remained in normal sinus rhythm
with a heart rate of 69, blood pressure of 116/59, and he is
ready to be discharged home today.  He has progressed to
physical therapy level V, ambulating without any difficulty.

PHYSICAL CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE:  Neurologically, the
patient has no apparent deficits.  The patient's lung
examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  His
wounds were clean, dry, and intact.  The most recent chest
x-ray was from [**2881-3-19**] which showed no pneumothorax
and no pleural effusion.  The most recent laboratory values
are from today, [**2881-3-21**], which include a white blood
cell count of 10, hematocrit 27.8, platelet count 120,000.
Sodium 138, potassium 5.1, chloride 102, C02 32, BUN 23,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 103.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. 12 hours times seven days.
5.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q. 12 hours times seven
days.
6.  Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o. q. six hours p.r.n. pain.
7.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o. q. four to six
hours p.r.n. pain.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his primary care
physician in two to three weeks.  He is to follow-up in the
Cardiac Surgery office in four weeks for postoperative check.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Aortic regurgitation, status post
aortic valve replacement.
