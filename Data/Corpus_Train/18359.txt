Endotraceal intubation on [**3451-7-8**]
Central line placement
Cardiac catheterization with no intervention


History of Present Illness:
65M w/PMHx CAD s/p 5v CABG, aortic valve replacement, aortic
arch graft, DM, HLD, HTN was transferred to the CCU s/p cardiac
arrest. Patient was found by family members to suddenly slump
over while sitting. Per family he was having problems with GI
upset and breathing after returning from a trip to CVS.  He was
dyspneic which turned to lethargy, cold clammy skin,
diaphoretic, pale, and finally unresponsiveness. He was held in
sitting position by family member. [**Name (NI) **] EMS, he was found to be
in agonal respirations shortly followed by cardiac arrest,
received 2min of CPR AED with no shock advised, had ROSC. He was
subsequently intubated in the field using RSI.  EKG in the field
reported 2nd degree AV block type 1 with LBBB.

On presentation to the ED, he was initialy HDS and a cardiology
consult was called.  Given setting of high K (6.7) and old LBBB
and possible respiratory arrest, cardiology decided to not take
patient to cath lab.

Patient continued to be persistently hypotensive and cards
consult was called back.  At this time levophed was started 0.03
which corrected the hypotension, and the fellow did a bedside
echo.  EF mildly depressed about 40% with possible apical
hypokinesis.  However, patient was bradycardic to 40s during
bedside Echo and received 0.5 g atropine which increased his
rate to the mid 60s transiently.   Also given 2L and put out
about 1 L

The patient's intial hyperkalemia was treated with 2g of calcium
gluconate for membrane stabilization, as well as 10U of insulin
with concomittant D50 administration. Repeat measurement of
potassium demonstrated an appropriate decrease.  He was also
given albuterol/ipatropium nebs which decreased his peak
pressures and improved breath sounds.  Vanc/Zosyn were started
for empiric antibiotic coverage. A R femoral central line was
placed due to his persistent hypotension- RIJ was not
accessible.  CT head obtained and neg for acute intracrainal
process per wet read.  CTA also obtained for concern of PE and
found no PE but bilateral groundglass opacities and widespread
consolidation.

On arrival to the floor, patient was intubated and sedated.
Dopamine drip started and levophed weaned off.

.
[**7-9**]: Cardiac Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3451-7-8**], no
clear change.

[**7-8**]: Head CT w/o Contrast
1.There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema or acute
territorial infarction.
2.There are multiple areas of hypoattenuation that likely
represent encephalomalacia from prior chronic infarctions.
3.The left maxillary sinus is completely opacified with
high-density material that could be due to inspissated
secretions or possibly due to fungual nfection.  Clinical
correlation is recommended to exclude a fungal infection.
.
[**7-8**]: CT Chest with and without contrast: IMPRESSION:
1.No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2.Status post aortic valve replacement and ascending aorta graft
placement for aneurysm repair, with no evidence of graft
failure.
3.Dependent patchy pulmonary consolidations likely represent
aspiration and or evolving pneumonia, in the appropriate
setting.  Upper lung ground glass opacities could reflect
additional component of pulmonary edema.
4.Low-lying ET tube extends only 1.1 cm above the carina, and
should be
retracted by at least 2 to 3 cm.

[**7-10**]: [**Doctor First Name 10194**] Duplex upper extermity: Normal appearance of the
bilateral internal jugular and subclavian veins.

[**7-10**]: Carotid U/S: The study is somewhat limited due to the
dressing for the right internal jugular line and the neck
swelling. There is mild heterogenous plaque bilaterally in the
internal carotid arteries. On the right side, the peak systolic
velocity in the common carotid artery is 114 cm/sec, in the ICA
proximally is 96 cm/sec, in the mid portion of the ICA is 111
cm/sec and in the distal portion 132 cm/sec. This yields an
ICA/CCA ratio of 1.2, within normal limits. The right vertebral
artery could not be clearly seen.
The peak systolic velocity in the left common carotid artery was
124 cm/sec. The peak systolic velocity in the left ICA
proximally was 140 cm/sec, in the mid portion 121 cm/sec and
distally 99 cm/sec yielding an ICA/CCA ratio of 1.1, within
normal limits.  The vertebral artery on the left demonstrates
antegrade flow.

[**7-11**]: EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring
study because
the background activity is continuous diffuse polymorphic delta
and occasional [**3-21**] Hz theta activity. This is suggestive of
moderate diffuse encephalopathy of nonspecific etiology. With
history of cardiac arrest, hypoxic brain injury is one of the
possibilities along with sedative medication, as the patient is
still on a midazolam infusion. There are no epileptifrom
discharges or electrographic seizures. Compared to the prior
day's EEG, background activity is slightly slower, indicating
slight worsening of cerebral function or additional medication
effects.
.
[**7-15**]: Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated severe three vessel native coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had a distal 20% stenosis. The LAD was totally occluded
proximally. The LCx had a totally occluded OM2. The RCA had a
new appearing total occlusion distally and an 80% AM stenosis
similar to cath in [**3441**].
2. Selective arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent
LIMA-LAD.
3. Selective venous conduit angiography revealed a patent
SVG-LAD. The SVG-OM-D1 and SVG-RPDA were occluded.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
hypertension with central aortic pressure of 156/68 mmHg.
5. Unsuccessful attempt at opening CTO of RCA
6. No other suitable targets for intervention

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD.
3. Patent SVG-LAD. Occluded SVG-OM-D1 and SVG-RPDA.
4. Systemic arterial hypertension.
5. Unsuccesful attempt at opening CTO of RCA.
.
[**7-18**]: ECHO
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The
aortic valve is not well seen. No aortic stenosis is seen. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not
well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global left ventricular systolic
function.
.
[**7-21**]: EP study
1. No inducible sustained tachyarrythemias
2. No evidence of an accessory pathway
3. No evidence of conduction system abnormalities

Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o male with PMHx of 5 v CABG, aortic valve replacement, and
asc aortic aneurysm repair with CVA, was admitted to the CCU s/p
"cardiac arrest" of unclear etiology.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Cardiac Arrest/Syncope: The etiology of the patient's loss of
consciousness remains in question. It is undocumented whether he
ever truly lost his pulse. Given the patient's extensive cardiac
history, arrhythmia, ischemia, and poor contractile function
were considered as potential etiologies. The patient presented
initially with unresponsiveness and with presumed conduction
delays given his prolonged QRS and bradycardia. He was also
hypotensive in the ED. Echo was relatively unrevealing at
bedside (EF 45%)and his troponins was stable over subsequent
days. ARDS, PE, Pneumonia, and aspiration were considered.  The
chest CT suggested a pulmonary process, but greatly improved on
the second day, suggesting aspiration pneumonitis. Patient was
initially also started on broad spectrum antibiotics which were
discontinued on subsequent days as he remained afebrile with
normal urine and blood cultures and without any source of
infection.
.
The patient received 0.5mg of atropine in the emergency
department for bradycardia and was admitted to the cardiac care
unit. He was stuporous; he had non-purposeful movement to
noxious stimuli. Patient was continued on pressors for better BP
management. He was brought to the CCU intubated and he was
easily ventilated and oxygenated. Based upon presumption
diagnosis of cardiac arrest, the cooling protocol was initiated
and continuous EEG was started, revealing nonspecific slowing.
The patient's primary process was thought unlikely neurologic in
origin given dramatic hemodynamic sequelae of the event and
negative CT head along with nonspecific slowing  on EEG.  On
[**7-13**] patient was weaned off sedation and weaned off pressors.
The patient was extubated as he was following commands and
appeared to be neurologically intact although he was delirious.
He was orientated to person and time and intermittently to
place.
.
During his CCU stay he had an episode of bradycardia with
complete heart block in the setting of severe GERD symptoms.  He
was found to have lost his consciousness temporarily. Based on
this episode, it was felt that his initiall presenting symptom
may have also been vagally mediated due to severe GERD.  He was
started on PPI and ranitidine with no further episode of
arrhythmias on telemetry.  He also had a cath which showed
severe three vessel disease with new occlusion in the RCA and
attempt at opening CTO of RCA was unsuccessful.  Subsequently he
han EP study which did not reveal any inducible tachyarrhythmia
or any new conduction abnormalities.  He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient for further evaluation and management of
his CAD.
.
# Delirium: After coming off of sedation and being extubated
patient was agitated and delirious. No infectious or neurologic
etiologies were identified. CT's showed no acute bleed, no Sz
activity, neuro has signed off.  His mental status continued to
improve as he was moved to the floors. On the day of discharge
patient was able to carry out intelligent conversations. Patient
was seen by PT and OT who initially recommended rehab however
after his quick recovery recommended sending patient home with
services and with outpatient OT.  Patient was also seen by
speech and swallow and his diet was advanced from nectar thick
diet to full diet on discharge.  Since being extubated patient
continued to have horse voice therefore he will follow up with
ENT on outpatient basis if his voice does not return completely.


INACTIVE ISSUES:
#CAD s/p 5v CABG, aortic aneurysm repair, and AVR: ASA, plavix,
statin, coreg were continued.
.
#DM: the patient received ISS while in house to good effect.  He
was discharged on his home metformin and Glyburide.
.
#HLD: The patient's atorvastatin was increased to 80mg daily.
.
# HTN: Patient was continued on his lisinopril.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient will follow up with PCP for further management of his
severe GERD
- Patient will follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further evaluation for
his CAD.
- Patient will follow up with ENT if his hoarse voice does not
become normal.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 68**].
You collapsed at home and came to [**Hospital1 68**]. You were on a breathing
machine with low blood pressure and underwent a cooling
protocol. A cardiac catheterization showed blockages in your
arteries but the physician was unable to open any artery. You
did not have a heart attack and your heart function is strong
according to the echocardiogram. An electrophysiology study to
assess your conduction system did not show any abnormalities
besides a known mild type of heart block (left buncle branch
block). We think that severe heartburn led to your collapse and
we have started three new medicines to help prevent another
episode. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may be able to further assess your heartburn
and may change your medicines or treatment for this.
You had delerium that was caused by your illness and sedatives
that was exacerbated by lack of sleep. It is unclear if lack of
oxygen to your brain has been a factor in your confusion as
well. Your memory is improving quickly and you are safe to go
home with continued occupational therapy at home. Your voice is
hoarse after the breathing tube and you have an appt with an
ear, nose and throat doctor on [**7-31**]. You can cancel this if your
voice returns to normal before the appt.
