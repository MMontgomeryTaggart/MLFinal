History of Present Illness:
85 yo F with hx of HTN, CHF, PPM for 2 degree AV block, presents
with increasing fatigue. The patient's family reports that she
has been sleeping 5-7 hours per night, rather than her usual
three. The patient herself reports that she has been sleepy much
more often than usual. The patient's sone reports that her
appetite has been dwindling over the past few weeks as well. The
patient's son also think she may have had a temperature, but
there is no objective data for a fever. The patient has been
having difficulty breathing as well, especially when she lies
flat. She has been sleeping sitting up intermittently over the
last few weeks. The patient denies any chest pain or
palpitations. She further reports some cough. She denies any
nausea, vomiting, or GI symptoms.

sinus rhythm. Supplemental oxygen was removed and patient had a
desat to 84% on RA. After 2L NC applied her O2Sat was in the
mid-90s though again had a desat to the 80s when lying flat. CXR
showing pulmonary edema. BNP elevated to 5053. 18g IV placed and
patient given 40 mg IV furosemide. Vitals on transfer were: HR
84 28 114/52 97% 2L NC.

.
[**5-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-4**] through
[**2827-5-20**]: Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild
interstitial edema has improved since [**5-19**]. Uniform
opacification of the right lower lung is probably atelectasis.
Mild cardiomegaly is chronic. Small bilateral pleural effusions
are unchanged. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
pacer leads are in standard placements.
.
[**5-19**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Mild congestive heart failure superimposed on severe chronic
obstructive airway disease.
2. No evidence of pneumonia.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2827-5-20**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve
leaflets. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH. During systole mitral valve and
chordae are pulled towards the hypertrophied upper septum and a
severe LVOT obstruction develops. At least moderate, posteriorly
directed mitral regurgitation. Very small pericardial effusion
without evidence of tamponade.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2827-2-5**], the LVOT gradient has increased
significantly. LV systolic function is not quite hyperdynamic on
the current study. The estimated pulmonary artery pressures are
lower. Pericardial fluid amount is probably similar.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman who presented with loss of
appetite, lethargy, dyspnea.
.
# PUMP: On presentation, the patient appeared to be having an
exacerbation of her diastolic CHF, based on her physical exam
and the imaging taken in the emergency department. The patient
reports she is compliant with her medications, but she has a
complicated home life that may make compliance difficult. She
may have had a dietary indiscretion (unlikely given reports of
her diminished appetite) or a worsening of her heart function,
although her troponins were negative. Her echocardiogram did
demonstrate worsening of her left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction, which may be contrinuting to this exacerbation. The
patient also had suggestion of infection by white count and
differential, but no source was found and leukocytosis resolved.
 Urinalysis not suggestive of infection; urine culture positive
for G+ bacteria (alpha-strep or lactobacillus), but
asymptomatic. The patient does have a foreign body (pacemaker),
but did not become febrile during hospitalization. Chest X-rays
not suggestive of pneumonia. Leukocystosis resolved. The
original mild pulmonary congestion was likely secondary to
severe MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2928**], [**5-21**], the patient had to be transferred
to the CCU due to tachypnea and hypotension unresponsive to
gentle boluses. In the CCU, the patient produced 500 mL over 24
hours with IV lasix 10 mg x 1 and responded well to metoprolol.
She did not have a recurrence of hypotension or of tachypnea. On
[**2827-5-23**], the patient was orhtostatic during physical therapy, but
she had received an extra dose of furosemide. She received
gentle hydration (250 cc) to which she responded well. By the
time of her discharge, she was back on room air, and Physical
Therapy had cleared her to return home. Social Work also
consulted, and she will receive nursing services at home,
including medicine checks, and also a visit from Elder Services
with a home safety evaluation.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient has significant risk factors for CAD,
given hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, long smoking
history, hyperlipidemia, etc. EKG did not suggest acute changes.
She was continued on aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin
therapies. Continued low-dose beta-blocker (metoprolol);
lisinopril held initially due to concern for acute kidney
injury, but returned to regimen on discharge.
.
# RHYTHM: The patient has a pacemaker implanted, but has been in
normal sinus rhythm.
.
#  COPD: Likely contributing to patient's dyspnea, although the
patient did not have wheezing on exam. She was provided with
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers standing and as needed and
continued on home fluticasone.
.
# Kidney injury: Patient has had increased creatinine since
early in [**Month (only) 115**]. Baseline appears to 1.0 for creatinine, but may
well be higher. [**Month (only) 115**] be acute from dehydration or part of longer
process. FeUrea 56%, suggestive of intrinsic process, may be
from diuresis (although patient came in with elevated
creatinine) or ATN secondary to episode of hypotension that sent
patient to CCU. Creatinine had returned closer to baseline by
discharge. She may need additional investigation as an
outpatient to determine her kidney status.
.
# Anemia: The patient has had a slow decline in hematocrit since
admission. The anemia is normocytic. The patient denies any
frank blood in stool, though she has been trace guaiac positive.
The patient does endorse hemorrhoids, however. Her reticulocyte
index ws 1.7, which suggests a proliferative deficit as opposed
to bleeding. Her MCV was within normal limits. Iron studies were
not suggestive of iron deficiency. She has been ordered for a
re-check of her hematocrit and hemoglobin and can be followed as
an outpatient.
.
# Hypertension: Continued home amlodipine therapy. Held
lisinopril early in hospital course.
.
# Hyperthyroidism: Continued methimazole therapy.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 10412**],
.
It was a pleasure participating in your care at [**Hospital1 764**].
.
You were admitted to the hospital because of fatigue and
shortness of breath. We think those symptoms were caused by an
exacerbation of your chronic heart failure. We were able to
remove some fluid and control your heart rate, which helped your
breathing. We also gave you nebulizer treatments to improve your
breathing problems caused by your COPD. It was also discovered
that you were anemic during your hospitalization, which may also
be contributing to your fatigue.
.
We will set up nursing to come check up after you and make sure
that you are doing well.
.
You should follow up with the appointments listed below to make
sure you do not become imbalanced in your fluids and that your
anemia can be further worked up. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is a colleague of
your primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
No longterm changes were made to your medications. You should
continue to take your usual medications as directed.
.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 137**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
