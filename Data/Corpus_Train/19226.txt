ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COURSE:  With regard to the atrial
flutter it was recommended informally by cardiology that the
patient get a whole week of Amiodarone 400 mg po b.i.d. and
then switch to 400 mg po q.d. starting on [**2830-2-11**].
From there on he would take 400 mg q.d. for a week and on
[**2-18**] start 200 mg po q.d. indefinitely until he was to
follow up Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 387**] in the Cardiology Clinic at [**Hospital1 47**].  He will also be receiving [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 852**]
of Hearts cardiac monitor, which will need to be pressed
several times a day by the nursing home staff since the
patient is unable to do so.  This is done to monitor for
bradycardia or other atrial flutter events while he is there
as an outpatient.  A clinic follow up date will be arranged
for him in cardiology and will be written on discharge
paperwork.  If there are no clinic dates set up we will
provide all phone numbers for health care providers that will
be following up with this patient.
