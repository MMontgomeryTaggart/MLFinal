CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Aortic dissection.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 67-year-old male
with longstanding hypertension who presented to [**Hospital 891**]
Hospital on [**11-18**] with approximately 16 hours of sharp
internal chest pain with radiation to the back.  It did not
change with movement.  In the Emergency Room at the outside
hospital he received morphine, which improved the chest pain.
A CT of the chest was done that showed an aortic dissection
with a type B and supradiaphragmatic in nature.  At that
time, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2138**].

At [**Hospital6 656**], he was chest pain
free and blood pressure and heart rate were stable.  Prior to
transfer, the patient was started on an esmolol drip.  At
[**Hospital6 656**] this was changed to a
labetalol drip.  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for placement of an arterial line for closed blood
pressure monitoring and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Seizure disorder.
3.  Subarachnoid hemorrhage in [**3289**], status post craniotomy.
4.  Hernia repair.
5.  Peptic ulcer disease, status post a Billroth II.
6.  Retinal detachment.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married.  He has two children.
Patient is retired.  Occasional alcohol use.  He has a 50
pack year of current one pack per day tobacco use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with rheumatic heart disease.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Univasc 15 mg po q.d.
2.  Depakote.
3.  Aspirin.

UPON TRANSFER:  Patient was on an aspirin, nitropaste,
Norvasc, morphine and Protonix.

ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT:
Vital signs:  Afebrile.  Blood pressure 130/50.  Pulse of 52,
breathing at 16, saturating at 97% on room air.  Blood
pressure was equal in both arms.  General:  Thin, older man
in no acute distress.  Oropharynx is moist without lesions.
No jugular venous distention.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 are normal.  No murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  Abdomen is benign with no palpable masses or
bruits.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Distal pulses 2+ in all extremities.  There is a bruit over
the right femoral artery.

LABORATORY DATA:  Notable for BUN and creatinine of 11 and
0.7, hematocrit 36.1, platelet count 258,000.  LFTs normal.
Troponin normal.

Electrocardiogram:  Sinus bradycardia at 54, no Q waves, no
evidence of ischemia.

CT of the chest reviewed at this institution revealed a type
B aortic dissection just distal to the aortic arch and
takeoff the great vessels extending down to the level of the
cardiac apex.  It is clearly supradiaphragmatic.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 67-year-old male with risk factors of
longstanding hypertension and tobacco use who presents with
chest pain.  CT of the chest revealed a type B aortic
dissection and is supradiaphragmatic.  Patient was admitted
to the Coronary Care Unit for intensive and invasive blood
pressure monitoring and control.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was continued on his labetalol
drip overnight.  In the morning he was changed over to
captopril by mouth.  this was titrated up as his labetalol
drip was titrated down and then turned off with a goal blood
pressure less than 120.  The drip was discontinued on
[**11-19**] with consistently good blood pressure control and
correlation between the arterial line and the blood pressure
cuff.  The arterial line was discontinued and the patient was
called out and transferred to the floor on [**3295-11-19**].
Physical Therapy Consult saw the patient and checked the
blood pressure with exertion.  Patient had no limitations to
exercise and walked 175 feet without a problem and his blood
pressure increased minimally.  A cholesterol panel was
checked and revealed a total cholesterol of 158, LDL 86, HDL
58.  This is a very good lipid profile, however, the patient
was started Lipitor 10 mg for added benefit.  While in the
hospital, the patient did experience some epigastric
discomfort consistent with his usual reflux disease.  This
was relieved with ranitidine po.  On [**3295-11-20**], the
patient's blood pressure was under good control and the
patient was otherwise stable and he was deemed safe for
discharge to home.  The patient was discharged with the
following medications:

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Valproic acid 500 mg delayed released po b.i.d.
2.  Atorvastatin 10 mg po q.d.
3.  Lisinopril 20 mg po q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to
discard his prior blood pressure pills, in particular
Univasc. The patient was instructed to follow-up with
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Phone number:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1708**] and
to see him within two weeks.  The patient was also instructed
to call his primary care physician for referral and to see
his primary care physician as needed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aortic dissection, type B requiring critical care for 48
hours.
2.  Hypertension.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient was discharged in stable
condition on [**3295-11-20**] to home.
