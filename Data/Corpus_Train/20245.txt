is a 60-year-old white male with a history of hypertension
and tobacco use who has had intermittent chest pain over the
past two weeks.  He presented to an outside hospital with an
episode of chest pain and was found to have a troponin I of
11.8.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital6 2138**] for cardiac catheterization.

Catheterization showed an ejection fraction of 40%, no mitral
regurgitation, left anterior descending with a proximal 60%
lesion and 70% midlesion after the diagonal, circumflex with
a 70% proximal lesion and 80% major OM, 90% ramus, right
coronary artery with 100% distal occlusion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, appendectomy as a child.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] runs a tack
shop.  Positive tobacco, 1?????? packs per day times 40 years.
Positive ETOH, two drinks per night.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol 50 mg q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 53, blood
pressure 143/65, respirations 18, oxygen saturation 97% on 2
L nasal cannula.  General:  The patient was a pleasant man in
no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive
to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx clear.
Neck:  Supple.  No jugular venous distention or bruits.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular,
rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused with no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurological:  The patient was
alert and oriented times three.  Nonfocal exam.  Grossly
intact.  Pulses:  Carotids 2+ bilaterally with no bruits,
radial 2+ bilaterally, dorsalis pedis 2+ bilaterally,
posterior tibial 2+ bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8, hematocrit 40.5, platelet
count 87,000; potassium 4.8, BUN 7, creatinine 0.8; PT 13.5,
PTT 36.2, INR 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The benefits and risks of surgery were
explained to the patient, and he was scheduled to undergo
coronary artery bypass grafting following an official
Hematology consult to investigate the patient's
thrombocytopenia.

The patient was seen by Hematology in consultation prior to
undergoing surgery.  They had no recommendations to change
any current treatment.

On [**12-2**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room
at which time he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.
Please see the operative report for full details.  In summary
the patient had a coronary artery bypass grafting times three
with LIMA to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery and to the obtuse marginal
sequentially.  His bypass time was 77 min with a cross-clamp
time of 60 min.  He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, the patient's mean arterial pressure
was 87.  He was A-paced at 80 beats per minute, and he had
Propofol at 35 mcg/kg/min.  He did well in the immediate
postoperative period.  His anesthesia was reversed.  He was
weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.

On postoperative day #1, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was weaned from all intravenous medications.  His
Swan-Ganz catheter was removed, and he was transferred to the
floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.

On postoperative day #2, the patient's chest tubes were
removed with the assistance of the nursing staff and Physical
Therapy.  The patient's activity level was gradually
increased.  He had an uneventful postoperative course once on
the floor.

On postoperative day #4, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be discharged to home.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.6??????, heart rate 73 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 130/70,
respirations 20, oxygen saturation 96% on room air, weight
preoperatively 107 kg, discharge 104.9 kg.  General:  The
patient was alert and oriented times three.  He moves all
extremities.  He follows commands.  Respirations:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.
S1 and S2 with no murmur.  Sternum:  Stable.  Incision with
Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Warm and well perfused with no edema.  Right
saphenous vein graft incision with Steri-Strips, open to air,
clean and dry.

DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.6, hematocrit 29.1,
platelet count 110; sodium 135, potassium 3.7, chloride 100,
CO2 28, BUN 11, creatinine 0.9, glucose 137.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Aspirin 325 mg
q.d., Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d., Lasix 20 mg q.d. x 7 days,
Potassium Chloride 20 mEq q.d. x 7 days, Percocet 5/325 [**1-20**]
tab q.4 hours p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times three with LIMA to the diagonal,
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and
obtuse marginal.
2.  Status post appendectomy.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Thrombocytopenia.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to home.

FOLLOW-UP:  He is to have follow-up in the Wound Clinic in
two weeks.  He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in six
