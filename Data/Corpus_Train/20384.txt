Brief Hospital Course:
# Septic shock/cholecystitis: Resolving. On admission, met
criteria for septic shock given temperature >38.5??????C and WBC
count of >12,000 cells/mL; lactate >2 mmol/L; systemic mean BP
of <60 mm Hg and need for dopamine. Source was most likely
biliary given CT findings and gram negative rod bacteremia.
Patient was seen by surgery who felt he was not a surgical
candidate.  The patient initially required brief peripheral
dopamine, but became hemodynamically stable within 12 hours and
it was discontinued.  He was intially treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics which were changed to ceftriaxone as both
gallbladder drainage and blood cultures grew
ceftriaxone-sensitive E. Coli.  A percutaneous cholecystostomy
tube was placed under ultrasound guidance on [**2617-4-3**] which has
continued to drain serosanguinous/bilious fluid since placement.
 It was then pulled out of place during repositioning of
patient. After speaking with radiology and surgical consulting
teams, as the patient was clinically well, with improving liver
tests, and given the morbidity of replacing the tube and
reversing his INR, the decision was made to defer replacement of
the tube.  In addition, ERCP was consulted who felt that he was
not a candidate at this time for ERCP given lack of obstructive
symptoms.  He will be treated with a total 2 week course of
ceftriaxone (day 1=[**2617-4-3**]).  He has a midline in place which
should be removed once antibiotic course is completed. Liver
function tests trended down throughout his hospital course.
The patient was hemodynamically stable for the remainder of his
hospitalization.
.
# Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 30 based on OMR from the
last several years, though per [**Location (un) **], his most recent Hct's
have been around 37. On admission, was 33.5, dropped to 25 and
has been stable and improving since transfer to the medicine
floor.  No evidence of bleeding, guaiac has been negative.
Fibrinogen, FDP, LDH, haptoglobin, reticulocyte count without
evidence of hemolysis. Tbili within normal limits. Iron studies
showed iron deficiency and possibly anemia of inflammation,
though ferritin not elevated, B12 and folate wnl.  Patient did
not require any blood transfusions during admission.
.
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Good oxygen saturations
on room air and minimal evidence of COPD on CT chest.  He was
continued on outpatient Montelukast with albuterol and atrovent
nebulizers as well as Advair inhaler.  Patient did not require
BiPap or intubation.  He was transitioned back to MDI inhalers
on discharge.
.
# Eosinophilia: Absolute count around 1000 and stable.  Likely
due to ceftriaxone as no other new medications.  Patient did not
have any signs or symptoms of allergic reaction.  Urine
eosinophils were negative.  It was monitored and patient was
continued on his current medications.  This should be evaluated
within the next few days to ensure no significant increase in
peripheral eosinophils.
.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 25% on most recent pMIBI in
[**2613**].  Was initially hypovolemic due to sepsis and received
several liters of fluid. Beta blocker was restarted once blood
pressure stabilized, and ACEI at low dose was started for
afterload reduction.  Patient was stable on this regimen.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine 2.3 on admission,
improved after volume resuscitation. Likely partially prerenal
given Na 10 on admission, though only mild improvement after
fluids. Creatinine 1.7 at NH in [**3-11**].  Creatinine improved to
baseline of 1.7 during admission after resuscitation and
resuming PO intake.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Status post PPM for tachy/brady syndrome.
On coumadin as outpatient. Initially with supratherapeutic INR
which was reversed for CCY tube placement. Now therapeutic on
home regimen of 3mg 5 days per week.  Rate-controlled with
V-paced rhythm.  Continuing beta blocker.
.
# Erosive gastritis: By report from NH, patient maintained on
PPI during admission.
.
# FEN: Ground diet, thin liquids, aspiration precautions.
.
# PPx: Coumadin, bowel regimen. Patient was on SC heparin until
INR therapeutic.
.
# CODE: DNR but can intubate for reversible causes
