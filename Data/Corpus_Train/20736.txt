HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old, white
male patient with a history of coronary artery disease.  He
is status post myocardial infarction in [**2498**] and also has a
past medical history of diabetes. He presented on the morning
of [**4-24**] to an outside hospital after having two to three
days of intermittent chest pain which did radiate to his left
arm and was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.  In the
Emergency Department, at the outside hospital, he was placed
on intravenous nitroglycerin.  He ruled in for myocardial
infarction with a troponin of 0.6 and a CPK of 107.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 58**] on [**2501-4-24**] for cardiac catheterization.  This revealed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 30% and significant three
vessel coronary artery disease.  He was referred for coronary
artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post myocardial infarction in [**2498**].
2.  Status post pilonidal cyst removal.
3.  Status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
4.  Status post bilateral cataract extraction in [**2501**].
5.  Non insulin dependent, diet-controlled diabetes type II.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Sublingual nitroglycerin prn.

ALLERGIES:  Percodan, causing nausea and vomiting.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does have a 90 pack year smoking
history; however, he quit 19 years ago and remote heavy
alcohol history but none in many recent years.  The patient
is married and lives with his wife and he is retired.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination was
unremarkable.

The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed significant
three vessel coronary artery disease with decreased left
ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.  The patient was taken
to the operating room on [**2502-4-26**] where he underwent
coronary artery bypass graft times four with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous
vein to obtuse marginal one, saphenous vein to diagonal and
saphenous vein to posterior descending artery.
Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit in good
condition on epinephrine, Neo-Synephrine and Propofol drips.
The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and
extubated on the night of surgery.  On postoperative day
number one, he remained on low doses of epinephrine and
Neo-Synephrine drips for continued hypotension with an
adequate cardiac output.  He was on a nasal cannula with good
oxygen saturation.  Over the course of the next 24 hours, the
patient was weaned off of his epinephrine, remained on low
dose Neo-synephrine for some persistent hypotension. He also
had atrial fibrillation on the morning of postoperative day
number two which was treated with intravenous Amiodarone and
the patient has subsequently converted to normal sinus
rhythm.

On postoperative day number two, [**4-28**], the patient had
his mediastinal chest tubes removed.  The left pleural tube
remained in place.  Due to fairly high output, although it
was mostly serous in nature, he still had a significant
volume of drainage from that left pleural tube and it was
thought best to leave it in until the drainage had decreased.
The patient was subsequently transferred out of the cardiac
surgery recovery unit to the telemetry floor on postoperative
day number three.  The patient began ambulation and continued
to progress adequately from a physical therapy standpoint.
Subsequent chest x-ray revealed a small left apical
pneumothorax with an intermittent air leak in the Pleura-Vac
from the left chest tube which had remained in.  Therefore,
the chest tube was left in for a few more days. Ultimately,
the air leak resolved.  The volume of pleural drainage
significantly decreased and the chest tube was removed on
[**5-1**], postoperative day number five.  The patient has had
no subsequent atrial fibrillation.  It was known upon removal
of the chest tube that he did have a small left apical
pneumothorax at that time and since the chest tube had been
removed approximately 24 hours after the chest tube was
discontinued, a subsequent chest x-ray revealed a very small
left apical pneumothorax, possibly a bit smaller in size than
previous.  The patient has remained on room air with good
oxygen saturation and he is being discharged home today on
[**2501-5-1**], postoperative day number six, status post
coronary artery bypass graft.  His condition upon discharge
today is as follows:  He is afebrile.  He is in normal sinus
rhythm with a rate of 76.  His blood pressure is 130/70;
respiratory rate is 20 with a room air oxygen saturation of
97%.  Neurologically, the patient is grossly intact. He has
no apparent neurologic deficit. On pulmonary examination, his
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His coronary
examination was regular rate and rhythm with no murmur noted.
His abdomen is slightly obese, positive bowel sounds.  He is
nontender and nondistended.  The patient states that he has
had a bowel movement today.  He has trace bilateral pedal
edema.  His sternal and right leg saphenectomy incisions are
clean and dry with no drainage, no erythema and the patient
is discharged to home today with [**Hospital6 **].
His most recent laboratory values are from yesterday, [**5-1**], which include a white blood cell count of 6.3, hematocrit
of 29.3 and platelet count of 288,000.  Sodium of 135;
potassium of 4.1; chloride of 98; C02 30; BUN 16; creatinine
0.8; glucose 132.
