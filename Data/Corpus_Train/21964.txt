Chief Complaint:
ICD firing three times

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT Ablation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 35991**] is a 75 year old male with past medical history of
type2 DM, atrial fibrillation s/p AVN ablation and several AADs,
CAD complicated by systolic heart failure with LVEF of 25%,
ventricular tachycardia s/p ICD placement and VT ablation in
[**2639**] complicated by right iliac artery disection requiring
emergent angiography and stenting.

He woke up this morning with ICD shock. He does not report chest
pain, shortness of breath, palpatations or syncope prior to the
episode. He went to his PCP today where [**Name9 (PRE) 1232**] interrogation
was thought to be inappropriate. He was instructed to go home
and come to the ED if he has ICD shock. He did have ICD shock x
2 this evening without any associated symptoms. He called EMS
and was brought to [**Hospital3 **]. Labs at OSH were notable for
normal electrolytes, creatinine at baseline of 1.56, BNP of 193,
nomral CBC and troponin of 0.068. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 68**]
for further management.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.2 70 141/91 18 100% 2LNC. EP
was consulted who recommended increasing metoprolol to 100 mg
[**Hospital1 **], trending troponin and admission to [**Hospital1 **] after interrogation
revealed his ICD shocks were appropriate for 330 ms cycle length
ventricular tachycardia.

Imaging

EKG ([**2644-9-5**]):
A-V sequential pacing with a very short A-V interval.
Ventricular paced
complex is of the appropriate left axis deviation, but with a
right
bundle-branch block pattern in the precordial leads consistent
with
biventricular pacing. Compared to the previous tracing of the
same date the overall rate has increased with uniform atrial
pacing rather than intermittent atrial sensing. Morphology of
the ventricular paced beats is unchanged.

CXR ([**2644-9-5**]):
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph there is no
relevant change. No pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  Borderline
size of the cardiac silhouette. Moderate tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta.  Pacemaker in left pectoral position.  No
pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo M with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, recurrent
Vtach, atrial fibrillation, and PVD who p/w recurrent VT. He had
an unsuccessful VT ablation, and was started on quinidine and
mexilitine, w/ suppression of VT, prior to discharge.

# Vtach: The patient has a h/o Vtach and is s/p 2 ablations and
ICD placement previously. He presented with recurrent Vtach from
a scar focus with ICD firing and ATP pacing successful in
terminating VT. The patient was taken to the EP lab and
underwent ablation. In the PACU, he had an episode of Vtach,
either from irritation of the myocardium from the procedure
versus failed ablation. The patient was given lidocaine bolous
and started on lidocaine drip in the PACU. He was then sent to
the CCU for monitoring. He was started on mexilitine and recived
2 doses before the lidocaine gtt was stopped. He was monitored
on telemetry without event. The mexilitine was stopped the day
after the procedure. He returned to the floor, and had two
additional episodes of VT the following day. He was started on
quinidine and mexilitine prior to discharge. At the time of
discharge, he had been VT free for over 24 hours.

# PVD: The patient has PVD and has a R iliac artery stent from
previous admission. During the cath, a long sheath was used that
traversed the stent. This occluded the stent and caused
transient leg ischemia. Once the sheath was pulled, LE perfusion
returned. Pulses were monitored and at time of discharge were at
his normal baseline.

# A fib: Coumadin was continued for goal INR [**1-5**]. Home
metoprolol and digoxin were continued. Because of interaction
with quinidine, coumadin was restarted post-EP procedure at a
lower dose, and he will need an INR check 2-3 days
post-discharge.

# CAD: Continued statin, plavix, aspirin, lisinopril, and
metoprolol.

# Chronic Systolic CHF: Continue lisinopril, metoprolol, lasix.
Patient received 80mg IV lasix x 1 on arrival to CCU because
appeared volume overloaded. He responded well and was euvolemic
the next day.

# DM2: The patient's home insulin regimen was continued and he
was additionally covered with ISS.

# BPH: Continue flomax

Transitional Issues:
- Follow up on hospital thyroid studies - TSH elevated, but T4
normal suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism
- Follow up INR check 2-3 days post-discharge
- Follow up with EP scheduled for Friday.

While in the hospital, you received a VT ablation procedure. You
were also started on 2 anti-arrhythmic medications. Please
continue to take these medications.
