.
CT head [**12-15**] 1am
IMPRESSION: Stable study as compared to the prior scan from
[**2561-12-15**], at 12:19 AM. Recommend repeat non-contrast
scan in one week to differentiate between a meningioma versus an
extra-axial hemorrhage within the left parietal region. These
findings were discussed with the trauma resident caring for the
patinet today at 11AM.

CXR [**12-15**]
Comparison is made to a prior radiograph from earlier the same
day. An endotracheal tube has been placed with its distal tip
below the thoracic inlet. A left-sided chest tube terminates at
the left lung apex. A pacemaking device overlies the left chest
with pacer leads in stable position overlying the region of the
right atrium and right ventricle. Subcutaneous gas tracks along
the left lateral chest wall. The lungs are clear with no
parenchymal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
several left sided rib fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION:
Lines and tubes in satisfactory position. Subcutaneous gas is
seen along the left chest wall with no pneumothorax identified.

T/L SPINE [**12-15**]
T-SPINE, 2 VIEWS: There is evidence of a chest tube. There is
some motion artifact, but no definite fractures are visualized.
Median sternotomy wires, clips, and pacer electrodes are
present. These are technically limited.
LUMBAR SPINE, 2 VIEWS: No visualized fractures. Residual
contrast is seen within the bladder.
Cannot exclude an interfissural location of the chest tube.

CT Cspine [**12-15**] 10am
IMPRESSION: This study was limited due to patient motion, but
there is no evidence of displaced fracture or compression
fracture. Sclerotic focus within the C7 vertebral body and the
spinous process of C2 of unknown significance. This should be
correlated with any prior imaging as well as history of
malignancy. Know left apical pneumothorax is visualized.

CT Head [**12-15**]
IMPRESSION: Small areas of subdural and possibly right
parenchymal hemorrhage. Lobular hyperdensity in the left
parietal region which may be extra-axial blood or a meningioma.
Further evaluation is recommended. These findings were discussed
with the trauma surgery and neurosurgery residents.

CXR [**12-16**]
IMPRESSION:
Extubated, satisfactory follow-up examination, no evidence of
pneumothorax.

CXR [**12-18**] wheezing
IMPRESSION:
1) Focal parenchymal opacities adjacent to acute rib fractures,
most likely representing areas of focal pulmonary contusion. A
small amount of pleural fluid or extrapleural hematoma is also
likely in this region.
2) No evidence of pneumonia.

CT HEAD [**12-31**]:
CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is no
expansion of the reported subdural hematoma and no mass effect
from the extra-axial space on the brain. The area of decreased
attenuation in the left posterior temporo- occipital region also
appears unchanged from the examination of one day prior,
consistent with an area of infarct. The lateral ventricles are
symmetric and nondilated, and unchanged in size and
configuration from the previous examination. There is no
interval change in mass effect or shift of normally midline
structures. The basilar cisterns are patent. The visualized
portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
normally pneumatized. No fractures are identified within the
surrounding osseous structures.

Although there is no change since prior exams, there is better
visualization of the superior aspect of the head and a
dural-based mass at the left vertex is seen, roughly 1.4x2.4cm
in size, and likely a meningioma.

IMPRESSION: Stable CT appearance of the brain from the
examination of [**2561-12-30**]. Left posterior
temporo-occipital infarct appears unchanged, as does a small
right frontal subdural collection. No evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage.

.
Carotid U/S: less than 40% stenosis b/l
.
ECHO:
INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and/or RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully
excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mitral valve not well seen. Mild to moderate
([**11-22**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA
systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.


Conclusions:
Technically suboptimal study.
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well
seen. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve is not well seen. Mild
to moderate
([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

If more definitive information regarding global and and regional
biventricular
systolic function is desired, a cardiac MRI ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 32280**]) or
radionuclide
study is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
Shortly after arrival to ICU pt was extubated without
complication.  Repeat Head CT demonstrated no change in the
subdural hematoma of the right frontal area and no change in
meningioma/CVA of left pariental area, neurosurgery signed off
for followup as an outpatient 2wks after discharge. HD2, chest
tube removed with no complication aand shortly after the patient
was transferred to the floor, eating well, drinking well,
ambulating to bathroom, but continued to have agitation
requiring a 1:1 sitter.
.
Once on the floor pt c/o intermittent chest pain, EKG with
slight variation of V3, enzymes sent, and cardiology consulted.
Pt had a NSTEMI but as SDH was so acute, was not treated with
anticoagulation or cath. He remained chest pain free without
intervention throughout the hospital course.  Neurology consult
for meningioma, parkinsons, and agitation- recs for zyprexa, no
change in parkinson's meds, and outpt fup of meningioma.  During
this time pt was brought back to the MICU.  Around this time pt
developed increasing shortness of breath and diffuse inspiratory
and expiratory wheezes with decreased air movement- CXR clear
without edema, effusion, or infiltrate- and he was started on Q2
nebs for likely COPD exacerbation.  Throughout all these events
with NSTEMI, COPD Exacerbation, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable with a lucid mental status and normal
neurologic exam.  Pt was transferred to the medicine service
with neurology, neurosurgery, trauma, and cardiology following.

.
In regards to the NSTEMI, cardiology recommends cardiac
catheterization once patient stabilized, on outpatient basis, in
6 months.
.
In regards to the SDH, by most recent CT [**2561-12-31**], this is
improving and the neurosurgery team cleared him so start Lovenox
treatment for his left axillary vein thrombus.
.
In regards to the CVA, echo was without clot and Carotid U/S
showed only 40% stenosis.  He was not started on Plavix in the
hospital at first because on the acuity of the SDH, and later
because he was already on anticoagulation with Lovenox and ASA
and was at considerable fall risk.
.
While on the medical floor, he was found to have a left axillary
vein thrombus with right cephalic vein thrombus, after clearance
from neurosurgery he started treatment on Lovenox.  The plan is
to continue the Lovenox until either one month from start which
was [**2561-12-31**] or until he leaves rehab if that occurs before one
month.
.
In regards to his ICD, this was tested by EP and found to have
suboptimal lead function but unchanged from the last outpatient
check by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 418**] in 6/[**2560**].  It is recommended that the patient
see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 418**] within one month to recheck device.
.
In regards to infectious disease, pt developed a staph aureus
and klebsiella pneumonia while on the ventillator, associated
with a staph aureus bacteremia.  This was treated with Levaquin,
and he is currently on day 10 of a 14 day course scheduled to be
complete on [**2562-1-5**].  He also developed a c.diff diarrhea, which
is improving and is treated with metronidazole.  The plan is to
continue this for two weeks after discontinution of the
Levaquin.
.
Pt also had sundowning at night and was started on Zyprexa
standing dose at night with good effect.
.
Finally, the patient had blood in the urine, with foley in,
which will require outpt work-up.
.
At discharge all urine and blood cultures were without growth,
CXR showed no sign of pneumonia or pulmonary edema, CT of head
on Lovenox had resolving SDH.
.
Patient needs outpatient follow-up with Neurosurgery and
Cardiology.
