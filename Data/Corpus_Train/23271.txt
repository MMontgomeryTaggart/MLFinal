5.9, the hematocrit was 36.2, and the platelet count was
150,000.  Sodium was 137, potassium was 3.8, chloride was
106, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was 17,
creatinine was 0.7, with a blood sugar of 134.  PT was 14,
PTT was 32.3, and INR was 1.2.  ALT was 21, AST was 13,

SU[**Last Name (STitle) 17722**]OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  Additional preoperative work was done and
showed a urinalysis was negative.  Electrocardiogram showed a
sinus rhythm at 64 with AV conduction delay.  The patient was
to be sent home and return on [**12-7**] for surgery.  The
patient was admitted on [**12-7**] but was admitted
secondary to another emergency cardiac operation that delayed
Dr.[**Known patient lastname 38630**] surgery.  He was also seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
of Cardiothoracic Surgery and was rescheduled for the
following morning and was admitted to the hospital.

On[**2804-12-8**] the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times four with a LIMA to the LAD, a vein
graft to the RCA, a vein graft to the diagonal, and a vein
graft to the [**Year (4 digits) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on a
titrated propofol drip and a nitroglycerin drip at 0.2
mcg/kg/min.

On postoperative day one, the patient had a blood pressure of
122/54 and a heart rate of 75, in a sinus rhythm.  He had
been extubated and was saturating 97 percent on nasal
cannula.  Postoperative laboratories as follows.  White blood
cell count was 8.9, the hematocrit was 32, and the platelet
count was 120.  Potassium was 4.3, BUN was 11, creatinine was
0.8, with a blood sugar of 145.  The patient remained on a
nitroglycerin drip at 0.2 mcg/kg/min.  Started Lasix and his
beta blocker.  The chest tubes were removed, and the
examination was unremarkable.  The lungs were clear.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  His incisions
were clean, dry, and intact.  He was transferred out to the
floor.

On the floor, he had a full evaluation by a physical
therapist to begin his ambulation with the nurses and
physical therapist.  On postoperative day two, the patient
had one episode of atrial fibrillation with a ventricular
response of greater than 120.  He was given 5 mg of
intravenous Lopressor which brought him down to the 90s.  His
blood pressure remained stable at 111/69.  He was saturating
97 percent on room air.  He remained otherwise unremarkable.
He was making good progress.  His chest tubes had been
pulled, and his pacing wires were pulled that afternoon
without incident.  The patient had minimal incisional pain.

On postoperative day three, he again went into atrial
fibrillation and was bolused with amiodarone and then given
an oral dose which converted him to a normal sinus rhythm.
He was started on amiodarone 200 mg p.o. once daily.  He
remained alert and oriented with a nonfocal neurologic
examination.  His examination was otherwise unremarkable.
The incisions were clean, dry, and intact.  He continued with
his diuresis.  He continued to ambulate well on the floor.
He was receiving Tylenol for pain.  He was voiding well.

On [**2804-12-12**] the patient was discharged to home.  He
was given some hot packs for a phlebitis that developed in
his right hand, and 500 mg of Keflex was given prior to his
discharge.

services for home care.
