Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4882**]
Chief Complaint:
enlarging vegetation on tricuspid valve

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tricuspid valve vegectomy


History of Present Illness:
62 year old female with history of recurrent prosthetic
tricuspid valve endocarditis with remote repair of tricuspid
valve, tricuspid valve replacement at [**Hospital1 577**] in [**3015**] and most
recently a redo tricuspid valve replacement in [**3015**] [**Male First Name (un) 657**]
tissue valve in [**3030**] for MSSA and Enterococcal prosthetic valve
endocarditis.
.
She was admitted in early [**3034-12-14**] with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8833**]
tricuspid prosthetic valve endocarditis with pulmonary embolic
phenomena. She was initially seen at [**Hospital3 751**] [**12-16**], with
respiratory distress and found to have multiple pulmonary septic
emboli on CT scan and tricuspid valve vegetations on ECHO. She
was in shock at the time of transfer. Blood cultures drawn on
[**12-16**] grew GPC and yeast(GPC ultimately found to be CONS
contaminant) and she was started onto echinocandin therapy on
[**3034-12-17**]. She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for ongoing
managment. At the time of transfer, she was on echinocandin
therapy alone as her antifungal [**Doctor Last Name 176**] and was persistently
fungemic. She was transitioned to ambisome on [**12-18**] as monotherapy
and then micafungin was added back on [**12-27**]. Her fungemia
quenched on [**3034-12-27**]. She was on ambisome and micafungin from
[**Date range (1) 38839**] and then was subsequently transitioned to micafungin
monotherapy on [**1-10**] soon after discharge to rehab. During this
admission, she was determined to be a non-operative candidate.
.
Her echo on [**3035-1-1**] revealed a 1.8 x 1.1 cm tricuspid
vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation. At rehab, she
had a persistent oxygen requirement prompting chest film. When
abnormalities were noted on that study, she had a CT scan of the
chest done on [**3035-2-4**] which revealed a question of possible
new cavitary lesion related to ? possible new septic emboli when
the CT was compared with the initial CT done at [**Hospital3 **]
on [**3034-12-16**].
.
Plan was for patient to have ECHO on day of admission followed
by appointment
in [**Hospital **] clinic. Due to transport issues, patient was unable to
make
it to [**Hospital **] clinic appointment. Given the findings of increased
size
of vegetation(4.9 cm in greatest dimention) on todays ECHO in
the
context of her overall clinical status and findings on chest CT,
decision made to transport to ER from ECHO for admission. At the
time IDs recommendations were:
-mycolytic and routine blood cultures(multiple sets)
-Continue Micafungin 100 mg IV Q 24 hours
-Would add liposomal amphoterocin B at 5 mg/kg/day
-Evaluation by Cardiology and Cardiothoracic surgical services
-Would consult ID for further detail regarding evaluation and
treatment plan
.
In the ED, initial VS were 100 84 98/56 16 100% 6L Nasal Cannula

As per call-in by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5293**] (pager [**Numeric Identifier 38840**])Pt was attending outpt
echo from [**Hospital 38841**] rehab hosp, + SOB. 62 year old female with
chief complaint of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8833**] endocarditis, now with
persistent oxygen requirement, worsened chest CT and worsening
tricuspid vegetation on most recent echo on micafungin.Needs
admission to start onto combination salvage antifungal therapy
and reconsideration of cardiothoracic surgical intervention

Pertinent Results:
Radiology:
ECHO ([**2-27**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The coronary sinus is dilated
(diameter >15mm). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. A bioprosthetic tricuspid
valve is present with thickened leaflets and increased gradient.
There is a moderate size (7mm) long mobile
echodensity/vegetation on the tricuspid valve. Mild tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
main pulmonary artery is dilated. Abnormal flow consistent with
a possible patent ductus arteriosus is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Well seated bioprosthetic tricuspid valve with
increased gradient and mobile echodensity c/w vegetation (may
also involve the leaflets). Right ventricular cavity dilation
with free wall hypokinesis. Possible PDA (vs. coronary artery
fistula). Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild pulmonary artery
hypertension.
.
Bone Scan ([**2-18**]):
1. Increased uptake in the lumbar spine may be related to
degenerative change, but concurrent infection is not excluded.
Correlation with gallium scan and SPECT-CT should be considered,
if clinically helpful.
2. Pooling of tracer in the right renal collecting system could
be within normal limits, but partial obstruction is also
possible. Clinical correlation advised.
.
KUB ([**2-15**]):
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction. There are a few
air-fluid levels in small bowel loops. There is air in the
colon. There is increase in fecal material throughout the
ascending and descending colon. There is severe scoliosis and
degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. Surgical clips project
in the hips bilaterally. Increased density in the left upper
quadrant suggests splenomegaly. There is no evidence of free
air.
.
CXR ([**2-13**]):
Lung volumes have improved, and mild pulmonary edema is still
present.
Additionally, there are small focal pulmonary abnormalities
attributable to septic emboli. No new large consolidation has
developed. Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild
cardiomegaly persists.
.
CXR ([**2-6**]):
IMPRESSION: Interval development of pulmonary edema. Other
findings of
peripheral opacities previously described as septic emboli and
bilateral small pleural effusions are unchanged.
.
EKG ([**2-6**]): rate of 91. Normal sinus rhythm with occasional
premature atrial contractions. Right axis deviation. Incomplete
right bundle-branch block. T wave inversions in  leads V1-V2
suggestive of possible anteroseptal ischemia. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**3035-1-1**] the T wave inversions in leads V1-V2
are new.
.
EKG ([**2-14**]): rate 58. Possible ectopic atrial rhythm versus sinus
rhythm with premature atrial contraction. Short P-R interval
without other signs of pre-excitation. Non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Right axis deviation. RSR'
pattern in lead V1 could be a normal variant. Non-specific T
wave changes in leads V1-V2. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**3035-2-11**] premature atrial contractions are less frequent.
.
EKG ([**2-26**]): rate 93. Sinus rhythm with atrial premature
depolarizations. Compared to the previous tracing there is no
diagnostic change.
.
TTE ([**2-6**]): The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. There is a mass in the right
ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis (increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). A well-seated
bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present with a large, highly
mobile vegetation (5.2x1.7 cm in maximum dimension) seen
prolapsing between the right ventricle and right atrium, with
likely significant tricuspid regurgitation [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] . There appears to be another
smaller (sub-centimeter) highly mobile mass associated with the
moderator band in the right ventricle (clips #57, 60). The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Large highly mobile vegetation attached to the
prosthetic tricuspid valve, with likely significant tricuspid
regurgitation. Possible small vegetation associated with the
moderator band. Mildly dilated right ventricle with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3035-1-1**],
the vegetation is larger in size (significantly elongated).
.
CT Chest [**3035-2-4**]
1. Wedge compression deformity at thorocalumbar junction with
focal vertebral body sclerosis. Given history of breast cancer
and reported back pain, findings could represent metastases.
Recommend bone scan.
2. New cavitated peribronchial opacities in right middle lobe
likely represent new area of septic emboli. Previously
identified septic emboli have decreased  in size.
3. Bilateral moderately sized low density (no hemorrhagic)
pleural effusions, with left effusion decreased in size.
4. Fibrotic changes in lingula with adjacent increased ground
glass opacities likely represent combination of post-radition
fribrosis and pulmonary edema.
5. Increased mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with necrotic
9 cm right paratracheal lymph node.
6. Enlarged incompletley visualized right renal pelvis, may
represent
parapelvic cyst.
7. Foci of calcification in right kidney, possibly
nephrolithiasis or wall calfication of an incompletey
demonstrated renal cyst.
8. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
==================
BRIEF PATIENT SUMMARY
==================
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 62 yo F w/ hx of A-fib, h/o IVDA, remote
tricuspid valvue replacement/repair x 3 who was admitted to the
medical ICU with marked enlargement of tricuspid valve Candidal
vegetation and borderline blood pressures.  The patient has been
deemed to not be a surgical candidate for valve
repair/replacement by [**Hospital1 68**] thoracic surgery and a second
opinion from [**Hospital1 577**] thoracic surgery. The patient has been treated
with ambisome for her fungal endocarditis, but the prognosis is
poor.  She also has a significant wound at the level of the
lower back, at the site of a previous spinal stimulator removal,
that has been evaluated by the wound care nurse, ID and
neurosurgery/back.  Unfortunately, considering her clinical
status (renal failure and hardware in body), there is not a
reasonable definitive imaging study, and she is not a surgical
candidate currently due to her functional status and nutrition,
to have the spinal hardware removed.  During the course of this
hospitalization, she had a percutaneous catheter-based vegectomy
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Interventional Cardiology ([**3035-2-26**]) to debulk
the tricuspid valve vegetation.  It was found that she had
thrombus in addition to vegetation, and thus was started on
coumadin for a goal INR 2.

# Fungal Endocarditis with valvular incompetence and complicated
by septic emboli - TTE prior to admission showed significant
enlargement (5.2x1.7cm) of patient's known tricuspid valve
vegetation. Infectious disease team was consulted. Infectious
disease recommended that patient be continued on ambisome.  We
appreciated ID input throughout entire hospital course. CT
surgery reiterated that patient is not a surgical candidate.
While in the ICU, a family meeting was held regarding patient's
poor prognosis without surgery, and decided they would like to
proceed with obtaining a second opinion at an OSH. The patient
was called out of the MICU on [**3035-2-9**].  While on the medical
floor, the patient was followed closely by ID.  We continued
ambisome, decreasing dose (to 300mg qd) once, secondary to a
decrement in renal function.  All blood cultures culture were
negative.  Multiple family meetings were held with the patient
and two brothers.  Prognosis was explained (very poor). Second
opinion from [**Hospital6 588**] also deemed the
patient to not be a surgical candidate. The patient's family is
actively pursuing other opinions.  The patient was offered a
salvage catheter-based vegectomy, performed by interventional
cardiology on [**2-26**].  The vegetation was significantly debulked
during the procedure, and it was noted that there was a
thrombotic component to the vegatation.  Thus, the patient was
iniatiated on warfarin 2mg qd, with a goal INR [**1-16**] (goal closer
to 2). Social work, patient relations and the ethics
consultation service were also consulted in relation to this
patient. The patient will be seen in infectious disease clinic,
and should have CBC, Chem 7 basic metabolic panel and LFTs
trended every week.
.
# Back Wound from spinal stimulator surgeries - Large, 4x6cm
wound located midline in the mid-back region. It is a large,
rounded edged, likely chronic wound, largely unchanged over the
course of the hospital stay. Wound care was consulted and has
been giving us recommendations regarding the wound.
.
Their current wound recommendations are:
Continue pressure relief measures per pressure ulcer guidelines.
Limit sit time to one hour.
Use pressure relief cushion when OOB to chair.
Continue frequent turn and repositioning.

Change wound care treatment to:
Spine: Cleanse with commercial wound spray.  Pat tissue dry.
Wipe periwound skin with barrier wipe.
Pack wound with regular Aquacel (Discontinue use of Aquacel AG).

Cover with DSD and ABD.  Secure with Medipore tape.

Coccyx: Cleanse with commercial wound spray.  Pat dry.  Cover
with heart shaped Mepilex.  Change q 3 days and prn.

Elbows: Moisturize [**Hospital1 **] with aloe vesta lotion.  Frequent turn
and
reposition.  Pad bony prominence to reduce pressure.  If patient
continues to favor her left elbow would consider applying a
waffle boot to off load pressure.
.
Pain control was achieved with morphine SR 30mg q8hrs and
dilaudid 2mg PO q3hrs PRN for breakthrough pain. Patient's pain
adequately controlled on this regimen. We restricted pressure on
this site by propping up lateral aspects of torso with cushions.
A bone scan was  performed [**3035-2-18**] to investigate for
osteomyelitis, and was inconclusive.  Neurosurg/back team
evaluated pt on [**2-19**], and they agreed that there were no feasible
options to further image the back to r/o osteo, considering pt's
tenuous renal function (CT w/ contrast) and significant amt of
hardware in body (MRI). There was extensive discussion with
infectious disease team and neurosurgery regarding potential
back wound surgical exploration and closure.  Given the
inconclusive bone scan and lack of other data supporting deep
infection as well as the risks involved with this surgery, we
felt the risks of pursuing surgery outweighed the benefits at
patient's current functional status.  The patient may benefit
from eventual removal of back hardware, as it may be a source of
infection.  If patient's functional and nutritional status
improve, the patient may consider surgical intervention in
future.
.
# Hypotension - The patient has had blood pressures stably in
the 80s-100s throughout entire hospitalization, and has been
asymptomatic. Likely secondary to poor forward flow from
tricuspid valve regurgitation. Patient did not require pressor
support or fluid resuscitation as she continued to mentate
appropriately. Clinic BP was recently 98/54 in medical record.
In setting of relative hypotension we have been holding ACE/BB.
.
# Urinary tract infection: pt w/ mild symptoms and repeat UA w/
e/o UTI on [**2-14**].  Treated complicated (foley) UTI w/ cipro (prior
pathogens sensitive) x 10d. Final day for abx was [**2-23**].
.
# Acute renal failure:  Pt's Cr on admission 0.9, peaking at
1.5, and now back down to 1.1.  Also, pt had UTI which has now
been treated. We renally dosed meds while she she was here.
.
# Tachycardia: patient with tachycardia early in hospitalization
secondary to atrial tachycardia.  the patient received 500cc
fluid bolus and tachycardia resolved.  For past two weeks of
hospitalization, HR has been 60s-80s primarily.
.
# Anemia: Stable 24-27 throughout admission.  No gross e/o
bleeding.  No e/o hemolysis.  No e/o bleeding.  Most likely
secondary to poor production in setting of severe illness.
Stable today
.
# Thrombocytopenia: stable. platelets have ranged from 70K-90K
.
# Hypoxemia: Likely secondary to poor tricuspid valve, pulmonary
emboli secondary to endocarditis and atelectasis from poor
functional status. O2 has been able to be titrated down to 3L,
with saturations 91-95% on 3L of O2.
.
# Hyponatremia - Likely SIADH from pulmonary disease. Sodium was
131-133 for most of hospitalization, and was 135 at the time of
discharge.
.
# Code status: patient is a full code.
.
# Emergency Contacts:
