IMAGING:
CARDIOLOGY*****************
TTE: ([**7-3**]) The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
global function. Right ventricle is dilated, hypertrophied, and
mildly hypokinetic. No vegetations identified. If clinically
suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography
does not exclude endocarditis.
.........................
TTE: [**3500-7-10**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve is not well seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). No masses or
vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study. No obvious vegetations identified,
but valvular structures not well visualized. If clinically
indicated, a TEE may better assess for valvular endocarditis.
Normal eft ventricular systolic function. Dilated right
ventricle with global hypokinesis. Marked resting tachycardia.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3500-7-3**],
the findings are similar.
...............................
TTE ([**3500-7-27**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF 60-70%) The right ventricular cavity
is dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis
VASCULAR
LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT on [**7-11**] or [**7-27**] studies.
RADIOLOGY
.....................................
[**3500-7-26**] RUQ U/S: 1. Large amount of sludge within the
gallbladder. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
.
[**3500-7-18**] RUQ U/S: IMPRESSION: Sludge within the gallbladder,
without son[**Name (NI) 487**] evidence for acute cholecystitis.
.
[**3500-7-12**] RUQ U/S: IMPRESSION:
1. Sludge within the gallbladder. No son[**Name (NI) 487**] findings
specific for acute cholecystitis.
2. Trace ascites. Right-sided pleural effusion.
.
[**3500-7-6**] Abdominal U/S:
IMPRESSION:
1. No signs of cholecystitis and no biliary dilatation.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Trace of ascites.
.....................................
 [**3500-7-25**] Head CT: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct, hydrocephalus
or edema. The ventricles and sulci are normal in appearance.
There are no fractures. There is diffuse opacification of the
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial process. Diffuse mucosal thickening
in the
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells.
.
[**3500-7-25**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening of bilateral effusions bilaterally,
consolidation and collapse. No evidence of loculated effusion.
Intravenous contrast
would be necessary to definitely rule out empyema.
2. Right upper lobe nodule, which is likely also infectious.
Suggest follow- up on subsequent imaging.
3. No acute intra-abdominal process, GB normal.
.
[**3500-6-30**] CTA Chest: 1. Extensive pneumonic consolidation
involving the lingular and apical posterior segments of the left
upper lobe, perhaps necrotizing.  2. No evidence of PE or aortic
dissection.
..........................
[**3500-7-14**] Renal U/S: IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound. No
evidence of hydronephrosis. Non specific enlarged size of
bilateral kidneys, [**Month/Day/Year **] correlation is recommended.
.............................
CXR ([**6-30**]) admission:
PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST: Dense airspace opacity involving the mid
left lung
with numerous air bronchograms is unchanged. The remainder of
the lungs are
clear, without evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is normal.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged pneumonic consolidation in the left mid
lung.
.
Brief CXR summaries: consolidation increased to complete
opacificatin of the entire L lung, c/w multilobar PNA. L pleural
effusions developed, along w/ increased consolidation of R
mid/lower lung zones. Some c/f superimposed CHF. Pneumonia on
CXR noted to be stabilized around [**3500-7-27**]. Likely progression to
fibrosis, resolving inflammation, hepatization,
stabilization/decrease noted in pleural effusions, improved
aeration of lung bases.
.
CXR (on discharge)[**8-5**]:
HISTORY: Progressive resolution of pneumonia.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-3**], there may be
further slight  decrease in opacification in the left lung
consistent with pneumonia. The right lung remains clear.
Tracheostomy tube is in place.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM
.
49 yoM with a hx of schizophrenia diagnosed with ARDS 2' to
Legionella PNA -- the patient was intubated for hypoxic
respiratory distress from [**3500-7-1**] to [**3500-7-27**], treated with a 21
day course of Levofloxacin, and received a tracheostomy on
[**3500-7-27**]. His hospital course was complicated by persistent
fevers attributed to a a pneumonia and later drug
hypersensitivity reaction (Zosyn vs. Vancomycin vs.
Ceftriaxone), a line infection, and acute renal failure
requiring CVVH.
.
1. Respiratory failure/ARDS from Legionella PNA: Patient had
hypoxic respiratory decompensation requiring ventilatory
support. He was diagnosed w/ Legionella PNA (positive Legionella
urine antigen on [**3500-7-2**]) and completed a 21-day course of
Levofloxacin on [**7-26**]. He was intubated on [**7-1**] and remained
intubated until [**7-27**].  He had extensive dead space, calculated
to be 67% on [**7-24**]. He had 2 BALs on [**7-11**] and [**7-25**] which showed no
growth on all cultures. His ventilatory settings were requiring
high PIPs and PEEP, with stable plateau pressures.  ETT was
found to be clogged with hardened secretions, and was unable to
be exchanged by anesthesia. Interventional Pulmonary was called,
and successfully cryoprecipitated and removed the hardened
secretions.After the ETT cleaning, and finishing his antibiotics
course, he tolerated a ventilatory wean, with a decrease in his
PEEP down from 20s to 8 on [**7-26**], despite demonstrated an
interval worsening of pleural effusions on Chest CT. His CXRs
showed stabilized PNA of the L lung after he was extubated on
[**3500-7-27**], and remained stable/improved for the remainder of his
hospital course. A tracheostomy was placed on [**7-27**], and he was
placed on pressure support with eventual transfer to trach mask
with cool nebs and oxygen. A PM valve was fitted by Speech and
Swallow on [**8-2**] so the patient could speak and use along with
his trach mask. His sedation was weaned from fentanyl drip to
fentanyl patch and versed drip to valium PO, and agitation was
controlled by PO and IM Haldol (see Schizophrenia below).
.
2. Mental status: Patient intubated/sedated from [**7-1**] until
[**7-27**].  He received trach on [**7-27**].  By [**8-1**], patient became much
more awake and able to follow commands as well as interact with
the medical team.  Mental status continued to improve and
patient received PM valve for intermittent use on [**8-2**]. On
discharge, he was interacting appropriately with staff.
.
3. Fevers, Sepsis- The patient had persistently elevated fevers
throughout his hospital course. The differential diagnosis was
broad, including:

-- CAP/HAP (+ Cx from [**7-20**] showed coagulase negative staph, and
patient was placed on vancomycin/zosyn for coverage of hospital
acquired PNA. His sputum and blood cultures remained negative,
and these antibiotics were stopped with the advent of the drug
rash, and he was transitioned over to Levoquin after his urine
legionella antigen returned positive.
.
-- Drug fevers: The patient was seen by dermatology on [**3500-7-17**]
for a worsening rash on his upper extremities and chest while he
was on Vancomycin/Zosyn. Dermatology diagnosed him with a drug
rash, (skin biopsy on [**3500-7-17**] showed focal spongiosis and
perivascular dermatitis w/ rare PMNs and eosinophilia c/w drug
eruption w/o vasculitis) with likely offenders being ceftriaxone
vs. B-lactams. He was treated with clobetasol, and his rash
resolved.
.
Pt subsequently had positive blood cx's and a R IJ catheter tip
cx positive for coag neg staph on [**3500-7-20**] and [**3500-7-26**],
respectively. He was restarted on Vancomycin on [**3500-7-20**] for a
line infection, and received a 10 day course. During this time,
he continued to spike fevers as high as 102 F, rigors (treated
w/ demerol), and rashes on his upper extremities, chest, and
flexor aspects of knees BL worsened. He was extensively cultured
throughout this period, with no growth. His differential showed
an elevated eosinophilia of 12.4%, leading the team to suspect a
drug fever to either Vancomycin or Zosyn. His antibiotics were
discontinued (Zosyn on [**7-29**], Vancomycin on [**7-30**] after a 10 day
course for his line infection), clobetosol ointment was
re-started. He defervesced to temps in the 100s, his
eosinophilia resolved, and his rashes improved.

Other sources of fever were investigated, but were ruled out,
including possible acute cholecystitis (LFT abnormalities and
elevated bilirubins noted, distended abdomen, icteric sclera,
but RUQ U/S negative on [**7-27**] and Abdominal CT on [**7-25**] was
negative), C. diff infection (negative x3), endocarditis (TTE on
[**7-27**] negative for vegetations), and UTI (urine cx's all
negative).
.
It was also thought possible that fevers during his early
intubation period had been masked previously w/ hypothermic
fluid from CVVH.
.
4.ARF- Cre peaked at 7.6 on [**7-16**]. Thought to be likely ATN in
the setting of hypotension and of exposure to possible
nephrotoxic drugs such as vancomycin. Line was placed for CVVH
on [**7-16**], which was continued until [**7-24**] when U/O began to
increase. U/O noted to be very dependent on BPs.  SBPs were
maintained in the 120s-160s, and the amount of fluid pulled off
by dialysis was titrated to blood pressure.  Patient was treated
with Lasix as needed to improve UOP and in response to fluid
overload/pleural effusions noted on CXR.  Creatinine slowly
trended downwards over latter hospital course, and was 4.4 on
discharge. Electrolyte abnormalities were treated as needed
(kayexalate for elevated Potassium, and renagel for elevated
phosphate.) His foley was removed on [**8-4**], and his urine output
remained well above 100 ccs/hr.
.
5. Anemia: In the setting of hypotension patient had coffee
ground emesis, requiring transfusion of two units of pRBCs. HTC
responded and then stabilized. Fecal occults negative throughout
and no more NG tube coffe ground emesis afterwards.   Anemia was
thought to be secondary to initial renal failure and sepsis. Pt
was on epo, which was discontinued prior to d/c. Hct stable at
~24 on discharge.
.
6. Hyperbilirubinemia: Patient had evidence of cholestatic liver
picture (persistenly elevated LFTs, bili elevated, sclera
icteric, distended abd), likely associated w/ TPN. Abd CT on [**7-25**]
showed no acute gallbladder processes. RUQ ultrasound on [**7-27**]
showed sludge but no ductal dilatation, wall thickening, or
stones.  Tube feeds through PEG were initiated. Starting on
[**8-25**], LFTs and Bili trended downward; ursodiol 300 PO BID
was started per hepatology and was continued on discharge.
.
7. Drug hypersenitivity rash: See Fever/Sepsis above as well.
Patient developed large dark brown to reddish purple, flat rash,
covering the back and armpit area from neck to buttocks, first
noted on [**7-10**]. derm bx showed focal spongiosis w/ perivascular
dermatitis w/ rare PMNs and eosinophils and rash was thought to
be [**2-17**] beta lactam or ceftriaxone. Topical steroids (clobetasol
ointment w/ saran wrap for improved occlusion) were started and
the rash improved.  He later began to spike fevers as per above,
and peripheral eosinophilia was noted (12.4%) and it was thought
these fevers were likely representative of drug fever.  He then
re-developed a desquamating rash with Vancomycin/Zosyn and was
restarted on clobetasol; the rash improved and peripheral
eosinophilia decreased slightly.
.
8. Schizophrenia: Patient had long history of paranoid
schizophrenia complicated by medication non-compliance resulting
in many psychiatric hospitalizations.  Patient's medications
were held while he was intubated; after extubation psych was
consulted re: patient's psychiatric medications.  Psychiatry was
instrumental in obtaining his past psychiatry records from
[**Doctor Last Name 1248**] and [**Hospital1 1661**] JP and [**Hospital1 **], which indicated that patient is
court ordered until [**1-24**] to take IM Haldol 100 mg q30 days, and
has been on Zyprexa (5-20 mg Qdaily) in the past.
.
He was kept sedated w/ propofol/versed/fentanyl during his
intubation. As he was transitioned to trach mask, psychiatry was
consulted, and he was started on haldol 1-2mg PO TID per their
recs, as well as haldol 5 mg IV/IM PRN agitation.  EKG was
monitored for prolonged QTc while on haldol, and remained < 440.
 He also had a standing order from state court mandating a 100mg
monthly haldol injection, which was given on [**8-3**]. His standing
haldol was then weaned and stopped completely on [**3500-8-6**]. His
sedation was also weaned from a fentanyl drip to a fentanyl
patch, and his versed drip was changed to valium 5 mg PO TID,
which was weaned and stopped on [**3500-8-6**].    He remained
appropriate interactive with staff, w/o psychosis,
hallucinations, or thought disorders after being extubated.
.
9. HTN: Patient was persistently hypertensive during his stay,
with high SBPs to the 180s.  He had no history of any
antihypertensive medication use.  Target SPB 120-160 and patient
was treated with standing labetalol and given hydralazine PRN
for BP control.  His PO labetolol was titrated to 200 mg PO TID,
and IV anti-hypertensives were discontinued.
.
10. Hypernatremia: Patient developed hypernatremia because of
significant free water deficit [**2-17**] fever, dialysis, tube feeds.
He was given free water boluses and IV D5W to correct the
hypernatremia.  His Na resolved to low 140s prior to discharge.
.
11. FEN- Patient was initially placed on TPN but this was D/C
after increasing LFTs.  Patient received PEG on [**7-27**] and then
received tube feeds.  Once he was off sedation and passed speech
and swallow eval, his diet was advanced to regular. His
electroLytes were checked daily.
.
# PPx: continued on PPI (d/c-ed on [**8-5**]), heparin sc,
pneumoboots, bowel regimen.
.
# Access: PICC line.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] with a diagnosis of legionella
pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that
required you to be intubated and mechanically ventilated from
[**3500-7-1**] to [**3500-7-27**]. You were treated with three weeks of an
antibiotic called Levofloxacin for your pneumonia. You also
developed renal failure (failure of the kidneys) requiring
dialysis (running your blood through a filter to remove the
build-up of toxic particles and electrolytes.)
You were eventually taken off the ventilator, and a tracheostomy
was placed in your neck to help you breathe, with a valve to
help you talk. You also developed a line infection, which was
treated with a 10 day course of antibiotics. You also had
persistent fevers and a skin which we discovered were due to a
drug sensitivity/allergy to Vancomycin and/or Zosyn. You also
have a PICC line (a peripherally inserted central line) from
which blood can be drawn and medication can be administerred.
You also were restarted on your psychiatric medications, as you
have been given your Haldol 100 mg IM, with your next dose due
on [**3500-9-3**]. You are also being discharged on Actigall for
treatment of your elevated bilirubin levels, and Labetolol 200
mg PO three times a day for your blood pressure. You are being
discharged to a rehabilitation center where your tracheostomy
can be properly cared for, you can obtain physical therapy to
become stronger, and your labs can be check daily to monitor
your kidney failure.
Please return to the nearest emergency department or contact
your primary care physician if you experience any of the
following symptoms:
Temperature greater than 102 F, increased shortness of breath,
worsened cough, increased chest pain with coughing, loss of
consciousness, shaking chills, light
headedness/dizziness/hypotension. Also return if your urine
output starts to decrease to less than 15 ccs/hr, indicating
worsening renal failure. Please also return if your mood changes
significantly, if you are having difficulty with your thoughts,
start hearting voices, or you start feeling thoughts of wanting
to commit suicide or to hurt other people, or if those around
you feel your previous symptoms of psychosis are returning and
you may be a harm to yourself or others. Please also return if
you experience any other symptoms not listed here that are
concerning to you or to your rehabilitation center.

Followup Instructions:
--Please follow up with the psychiatrists who follow you (Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12195**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12196**], [**Location (un) 11935**] Community Health
