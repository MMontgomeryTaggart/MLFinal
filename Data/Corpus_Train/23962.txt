Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 954**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy to evaluate the position of the Trach.  Trach
Removal and [**First Name3 (LF) **] removal


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75 yo man w/ COPD, HTN, recent complicated CCU admit
([**Date range (3) 40031**]) with NSTEMI, intubation, PEA arrest at cardiac
cath, IABP, tracheostomy, H influenza pna, MRSA pneumonia tx w/
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] placement, AVM/GI bleed, who presents from [**Hospital **]
Hospital with acute resp distress, hypoxia. Most of history
obtained from chart and patient's son, who is at his bedside.
Patient reports he was in his USOH, doing well at rehab until
last night, when he acutely became SOB w/ increased secretions.
He was noted to have sats in the 70's on his 2L and was placed
on a non rebreather with improvement in sats to 100%. They were
unable to suction from his trach and he was sent to the ED for
evaluation. Of note, his trach was capped last week and he has
been on a nasal cannula at 2L since that time w/o incident. Also
of note, pt has been eating well independently and [**Hospital **] has not
been used. Patient denies any known aspiration event and has
been eating w/o incident for many days. He denies fevers but
does report a "cold sweat" last night. He also says he has felt
fatigued over the last few days. Denies diarrhea/chest pain/ abd
pain/ headaches. Has some chronic urinary incontinence and foley
was just d/c'd last week. He has been urinating on his own since
then. Pt had some bloody secretions and feels he has been able
to cough up his mucous well until this am. Has a strong gag per
patient. On [**Name (NI) 40032**] pt has had a petechial rash on his legs that
was thought to be due to lasix or paxil. It was biopsied by
dermatology at [**Hospital1 **]-- much improvement over last few days.
*
In ED, mild hypoxia (91% RA, tachy 120's, low grade temp), rec'd
1 g vanco, 500 mg IV flagyl, albuterol/atrovent, CT surgery
called for eval of trach. VSS, sats improved w/ ventimask. ABG
AT [**Hospital1 **] 7.2/85/107 (ON NRB??- UNSURE)
*
Patient was then sent to floor and abx coverage switched to
vancomycin/ zosyn. He went to OR procedure for replacement of
trach and hours later developed hemoptysis and hypoxia down to
mid 80's requiring suctioning and NC to 10L and trach mask.
Despite the latter patient's oxygenation did not improve. They
called a MICU consult for evaluation of hypoxia. Once MICU team
arrived to floor patients sats had increased to low 90's, tachy
to 100-120's, blood pressure 120's/70's, RR to 30's but with
abdominal breathing and respiratory retractions. Cycled cardiac
enzymes ruled patient in for NSTEMI.
Patient was then transferred to ICU.
*
ICU course:
Pt Hypoxic and in respiratory distress on presentation to ICU.
Pt initially coved with vanc/zosyn for PNA, however these were
d/c'ed after culture results. Underwent a bronchoscopy to
evaluate for the location of trach, it was in ant. mediastinum.
Replaced under video.  [**Last Name (un) **] also revealed 3 polypoid lesions in
LLL which were biopside.Pt eventually coughed it out and trach
was removed and remained stable with weaning of O2 down to
3L/min (baseline 1.5cc/min).
Cardiac
Pt was continued on ASA/statin/BB and was started on ACEI
.
Pt was transferred to the floor and remained stable.  He had no
further c/o SOB.

cath w/ PEA arrest---> resuscitated w/ epi/pressors
2. EF 35% 1-2+MR [**5-7**] echo (had flash pulm edema on last admit)

3. COPD on home Oxygen (2L for years) Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is pulm
fev1 590 cc by report- no pft's here
4. h/o pneumothorax
5. depression
6. IABP on last admit- was evaluated by CT surgery for CABG but
was thought not to be a surgical candidate given MMP
7. ARF on last admit - Cr 1.7, now 0.98

by IR (after 4 bleeding scans, c scope, push enteroscopy,etc)

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo man w/ complicated recent PMH including PEA arrest,
prolonged intubation w/ trach, MRSA/H influenza pna, GI bleed,
here w/ multilobar pneumonia.  Pt sent to unit secondary to
hypoxia and respitory distress earlier.  In the unit pt received
nebs and respiratory support.  Pt remained stable in the unit
and was sent to floor.

1. REsp distress: Baseline for pt is 2L O2 at home with COPD.
He was initially treated empirically for possible mulifocal pna
(asp, CAP, vent-assoc pna), however pt remained afebrile and
sputum culture (a good specimen) grew only sparse staph aureus.
Pt believed to be colonized only and antibiotics were stopped in
MICU. More likely etiology is cardiac given NSTEMI and CHF. Pt
presented with trach, which upon examination during bronchoscopy
was found to be in the mediastinum and was removed. Resp status
improved after trach removal.  Pt transferred from MICU satting
well on 4LNC with Serovent QID.
-lactate 1.5 and HD stable, which is reassuring.
Pt remained stable satting above 92% on 4L NC on the floor
-hypoxia resolved after bronch and removeal of trach.
-Chest PT
-Home O2
-no indication for abx. were d/c;d in MICU.
*

Pt will be sent home with prednisone 5mg, serovent, albuterol
and salmeterol.

free.  Continue to afterload reduce with captopril 6.25mg tid.
Will Followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Mid [**Month (only) 314**] for likely therapeutic
cath.
