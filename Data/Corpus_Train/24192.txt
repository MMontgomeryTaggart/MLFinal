HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 40508**] is a 73 year-old
female who presented following the onset of acute headache,
occurring at approximately 8 p.m. on [**2834-5-30**]. She was at a
church group when the headache occurred. She did not lose
consciousness.  She presented to an outside hospital where a
CT scan demonstrated diffuse subarachnoid blood throughout
the basal cisterns and over the convexity of the bilateral
cerebral hemispheres.  CT angiogram was done following this
after she was transferred to [**Hospital1 1499**]. This demonstrated a small aneurysm of the left
superior cerebellar artery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, high
cholesterol, question of a CVA in the past and angina.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor 50 mg twice a day,
Celexa 20 mg q. day, Pravachol 40 mg q. day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, blood pressure was
198/85; heart rate 82; 22, 100% on two liters. She was awake,
alert, oriented times three, positive meningismus.  Followed
commands times four.  Speech was fluent.  Pupils were equal
and reactive to light and accommodation.  EOM's were full.
Finger to nose intact.  Visual fields full to confrontation.
Face symmetric.  Tongue was midline.  No drift.  Grips at
IP's and gastrocs were all [**5-24**].

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium was 139; BUN 18; creatinine 0.9.
Hematocrit was 42.  White count was 10.  Platelets were 291.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the neurosurgery
service, that is to the ICU where she had q. 1 hour neuro
checks, q. 1 hour vital signs.  Her blood pressure was
strictly controlled to less than 130.  She was started on
Dilantin and on Amlodipine 60 mg p.o. q. 4 hours.  She
[**Month/Day (1) 767**] a diagnostic cerebral angiogram and a coiling.  She
had a successful coil embolization of a narrow neck, 5 by 3.5
mm aneurysm in the left superior cerebellar artery origin
without evidence of apparent vessel stenosis or branch
occlusion.  A small amount of residual filling the center of
the coil mass in the aneurysm dome was noted.  During that
procedure, she had a ventriculostomy drain placed. She was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where her ICP was from
4 to 8.  She had been extubated, somnolent.  She moved all
extremities, uppers greaters than lowers.  She had good
strength.  She spoke some Portuguese words with her family
and spoke simple English words.  She followed commands times
four.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Face was full. Her blood pressure was
continued to be kept at less than 130. Her vent drain was at
12 cm.  She was started on aspirin 81 mg and she had an
electrocardiogram to rule out myocardial infarction.  On her
first postoperative day, she remained awake, alert and
oriented times three, following commands times four.  Pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Her troponins were negative for myocardial infarction and she
had a central line placed for CVP monitoring.  She had a head
CT which showed a slight decrease in the subarachnoid
hemorrhage, no new hydrocephalus.  Also, she had new left
frontal occipital lobe infarcts.  She had bilateral
enlargement of the superior ophthalmic veins which was
thought to be reflective of intracranial pressure.

On her second postoperative day, it was noted that her
saturations had dropped to be approximately 89 to 96%.  Her
blood gas at that time showed a P02 of 70.  At that point, it
was determined that she should be intubated to improve her
P02 and her oxygen saturation.  She had a CT angiogram of her
chest to look for pulmonary embolism which was ruled out.
However, it did show that she had bilateral pleural effusions
with associated atelectasis. During this time, she was also
ruled in for a myocardial infarction which a troponin
increase.  She was seen by cardiology.  They felt that she
had some transient lateral ST depression and some demand
ischemia versus acute coronary syndrome.  At that time, she
couldn't be anticoagulated given her intracranial bleed.
They thought that the likelihood of benefit was small unless
she had continued ongoing ischemia.  She had already been on
aspirin as part of her coiling procedure and they recommended
continuing that.  She, however, was not rate controlled with
Lopressor due to the possibility of starting or increasing
the likelihood of vasospasm. During her intubation time
frame, she was kept sedated; however, she did move all four
extremities.  She would open her eyes to voice and follow
commands; however, the command seemed to be better for her
family speaking Portuguese than in English. Her cardiology
status was followed closely. She had regular
electrocardiograms done on a twice a day basis and her
troponins continued to be followed. She had an echocardiogram
done on [**6-4**] which showed overall left ventricular systolic
function, normal ejection fraction of greater than 55%.  Her
mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.  She had 1+
mitral regurgitation along with her tricuspid valve leaflets
which were also mildly thickened.  She had mild pulmonary
systolic hypertension.  She had periods on her
electrocardiogram of ischemia and periods of her heart rate
being greater than 100 and her blood pressure being greater
than 140.  After a long discussion with cardiology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 134**]
and the cardiology attending agreed that her blood pressure
should be kept in the 140 range. She was started in a
Nitroglycerin drip to assist with vasodilation and to help
keep her blood pressure less than 140.

On [**6-5**], she [**Month/Year (2) 767**] a CTA which showed a stable appearance
of the subarachnoid hemorrhage and an area of focal decreased
attenuation within the right basal ganglia and left
cerebellum, likely thought to be infarcts.  However, the
major vascular tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 983**] anteriorly
were visualized and did not appear to exhibit vasospasm.
Cardiology had recommended withholding triple H therapy, as
far as pushing her blood pressure, and continued not to force
hypertension, recommended using Isorbid or Cardizem to treat
vasospasm.

On [**2835-6-6**],  Ms [**Known patient lastname 40508**] [**Last Name (Titles) 767**] a diagnostic cerebral
angiogram to test her vasospasm which showed a moderate
diffuse vasospasm which was treated with Verapamil.  Her
examination on that day, she was tracking on examination and
moving all four extremities, still intubated and withdrew
uppers and lowers, grimaced to pain.  However, she was not
following commands.  She was given a unit of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit of 27.4.  She had begun spiking some
fevers and her CSF showed no micro-organisms.  Her vent drain
was at 12 cm above the tragus.  Also, for her fevers, she had
bilateral Dopplers of her lower extremities which were
negative.

On [**6-7**], it appears that she was extubated without
difficulty. She required face supplemental mask 50% oxygen.
She had aggressive pulmonary toilette.  She continued to have
fevers through the [**10-10**] which showed sparse proteus in
her sputum.  Also, her chest x-ray showed congestive heart
failure, pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions. She was
treated with Lasix and pulmonary toilette.

From [**6-10**] to [**6-13**], her ventriculostomy drain was raised to
20.  Her mental status had improved.  She was more awake,
alert and attentive.  Eyes were open. She followed commands
bilaterally. Her respiratory status had also improved;
however, she still required aggressive pulmonary care with
frequent nebulizers and pulmonary toilette.  Her ICP remained
in the 7 to 8 range.  Her blood pressure remained in the 120
to 150 range.  She did require neo-Synephrine to keep her
blood pressure greater than 130 at times.  On [**6-14**], her
ventriculostomy drain was discontinued without difficulty.
On [**6-15**], she had a speech and swallow examination which
showed overt and soft aspiration after all p.o.'s
administered.  She was maintained n.p.o. and continued with
nasogastric tube feedings.  On [**6-16**], she was transferred to
the neuro step-down unit.  She remained awake, alert,
oriented to person. She knew she was in the hospital.  She
followed commands.  She mostly spoke Portuguese.  She had
good strength throughout.  She had a repeat swallow test on
[**6-19**] which showed aspiration of thin liquids and some
pocketing of solids. She had her nasogastric tube
discontinued and advanced her diet to nectar-thick liquids
and pureed foods, with no thin liquids.  She remained
neurologically stable in the neuro step-down unit.  She was
afebrile, following commands but, at times, had some periods
of lethargy.  For that reason, she had a repeat head CT which
did not show any overt signs of hydrocephalus.  She [**Month/Day (4) 767**]
a lumbar puncture just to rule out high ICP's.  Her opening
pressure on [**6-20**] was 15, her closing was 6.  CSF was sent for
culture and gram stain.  Her CSF showed WBC's of 36 in tube 1
and 14, in tube 4.  For that reason, we called infectious
disease as a curb-side consult.  They initially recommended
starting her on Vancomycin and Ceptaz.  The patient also had
a positive urine culture which showed Pseudomonas in her
urine.  However, after a formal ID consult, they recommended
just treating her urine pseudomonas with Ciprofloxin and not
treating her CSF. They felt this was a normal variant for her
procedures.

On [**2835-6-23**], she was transferred from the neuro step-down to
the surgical floor.  She remained awake, alert, oriented
times three, following commands, working with physical
therapy.  All of her subarachnoid prophylaxis medications,
such as Nimodipine were discontinued.  She no longer required
any oxygen.  Her lungs were essentially clear and she was
screened for acute rehab and currently being treated with
Ciprofloxacin for 7 days of coverage for her pseudomonas in
her urine.

At this dictation, she is tolerating pureed diet with honey-
thickened liquids, which she appears to be tolerating and
maybe able to advance prior to her discharge on [**6-25**]. She will
be seen by speech and swallow for further evaluation at that
time.
