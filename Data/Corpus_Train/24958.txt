Esophagus: Resection Synopsis
MACROSCOPIC

Specimen Type:  Esophagogastrectomy.

Tumor site:  Gastroesophageal junction.

Tumor Size
     See comment.

MICROSCOPIC

Histologic Type:  Adenocarcinoma.

Histologic Grade:  Not applicable due to irradiation.

EXTENT OF INVASION

Primary Tumor:  pT2:  Tumor invades muscularis propria.

Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.

Lymph Nodes
    Number examined:  13.
    Number involved:  0.

Distant metastasis:  pMX:  Cannot be assessed.

Margins
    Proximal margin:  Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
    Distal margin:  Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
    Circumferential (adventitial) margin:  Uninvolved by
invasive carcinoma.
    Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin:  1 mm
(Circumferential). Keratin immunostains evaluated.

Lymphatic (Small Vessel) Invasion:  Absent.

Venous (Large vessel) invasion:  Absent.

Additional Pathologic Findings:  Intestinal metaplasia,
dysplasia.

Comments:  1. The tumor size is difficult to assess because of
treatment effect. The grossly described nodule which measures
2.2 cm shows scattered tumor nests with very prominent
fibroblastic reaction.

2. There are rare, small mucinous collections in the adventitia
of the esophagus with no associated tumor cells as being
evaluated by immunostains.

Clinical:  Esophageal cancer - status post chemotherapy.
Gross:
The specimen is received fresh labeled with "[**Known patient lastname 41948**], [**Known patient firstname **]"
and the medical record number and "esophagogastrectomy specimen"
and consists of a segmental resection of esophagus and proximal
stomach measuring 26 cm in length.  There is a stapled proximal
resection margin measuring 2.5 cm in length and a stapled distal
resection margin measuring 8.5 cm.  There is an additional
staple line present 4 cm from the proximal resection margin. The
attached fat measures up to 5 cm in length.  The outer portion
of the specimen is remarkable for an area of firmness felt
around the gastroesophageal junction.  This area is inked in
black. The specimen is opened to reveal a fungating pink tan
mass measuring 2.2 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm at the GE Junction along the
side of the greater curvature. This mass lies 2.5 cm from the
distal resection margin and 24 cm from the proximal resection
margin. The total length of esophagus measures 24 cm.  The
mucosa from the GE junction appears tan, [**Location (un) 114**] and irregular,
suggestive of Barrett's esophagus and extends for 12 cm. There
is an irregular Z-line that lies 10 cm from the proximal
resection margin. The mass is sectioned to reveal invasion into
the muscular layer.  It does not appear to extend through the
serosa. The gastric mucosa appears unremarkable. Multiple lymph
nodes are identified measuring up to 4.2 cm. The specimen is
represented as follows: A = stapled distal resection, B =
stapled proximal resection margin of esophagus, C = distal
resection margin, D-F = tumor, G = GE junction, H = stomach, I =
Z-line, J = esophagus, K = area near second staple line near
proximal resection margin, L = area of largest lymph node, M-Q =
individual lymph nodes.

Part 2 is additionally labeled "subcarinal lymph node" and
consists of a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm lymph node that is bisected and
entirely submitted in R.

Part 3 is additionally labeled "para-esophageal lymph nodes and
consists of a lymph node and associated fat measuring 1.2 x 0.7
x 0.4 cm. It is bisected and entirely submitted in S.

Part 4 is additionally labeled "spleen" and consists of a 75
gram spleen measuring overall 8.5 x 6 x 2.5 cm.  There is a
stapled resection margin at the hilum measuring 6 cm. The
specimen is sectioned to reveal unremarkable beefy red cut
surfaces. No abnormalities are noted. Representative sections
are submitted in T-U.

INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function  (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a
focal LV wall motion abnormality  cannot be fully excluded.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. LV inflow
pattern c/w  impaired relaxation.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.


Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Crimson Surgery service and
underwent minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy converted to
open with splenectomy and feeding jejunostomy on [**3232-2-3**] by Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) 60**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 456**] (see op note for details). He remained
intubated postoperatively and was transferred to the CSRU in
stable condition. The patient was resuscitated with crystalloid
and packed red blood cells POD 1 due to low urine output. He
remained sedated and intubated.

POD 2, trophic tube feedings were initiated. He was extubated
and remained in stable condition. Ativan and Haldol had to be
administered a couple of times for agitation, confusion, and
tube/IV pulling.  However, once his mentation normalizes, he
progressed nicely.  He was maintained on a heparin drip for his
paroxysmal afib and received nutrition via tube feeding.

On POD 15 he was transferred to the cardiac floor where he
stayed until day of discharge.

On POD 16 he passed his bedside swallow evaluation for pureed
foods and nectar thick liquids. He continues to aspirate thin
liquids, however this is expected to improve.

On POD 17, he was give Pneumovac, H. influenza B, Meningicoccus
vaccines.  His INR was therapeutic on warfarin (given for
paroxysmal afib, pt currently in sinus rhythm, goal INR 2.0) and
the heparin drip was discontinued.

On POD 20 he was dishcarged to a rehabilitation center in fair
condition with specific instructions for post-hospital care and
follow-up.
