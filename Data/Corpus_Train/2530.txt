Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional left ventricular wall motion findings
as shown below; remaining LV segments contract normally.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**1-28**]+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with
assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope.
No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre-procedure: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left
atrial appendage. The basal left ventricular segments contract
normally. Mid and distal segments are hypokinetic. EF = 30 -
35%. There is moderate global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Post Procedure: Mild improvement in LV systolic fxn. MR remains
1 - 2+. No AI. Aorta intact. RV mildly hypokinetic. Other
parameters as pre-procedure.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3440-11-14**] 2:33 PM
Two views. Comparison with [**3440-11-11**]. There is interval
improvement in a small focal area of increased density in the
lower left lung. There is continued blunting of the left
costophrenic sulcus consistent with pleural fluid. The right
lung remains clear. Surgical clips are projected in the left
anterior chest as before. The heart is normal in size.
Mediastinal structures are unremarkable. The bony thorax is
grossly intact.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in left basilar infiltrate.
Persistent left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on 1o/12 where he underwent
an off pump CABGx1 with thorascopic LIMA harvest via mini
thoracotomy. He was transferred to the ICU in critical but
stable condition. He was extubated later that same day. He was
started on plavix for his off pump CABG. He was seen by the
chronic pain service, was started on a PCA and then dilaudid and
motrin, and was restarted on his methadone and neurontin. He was
seen by psychiatry for coping and conflict with his outpatient
psychiatrist. He did well postoperatively and was ready for
discharge home on POD #10.
