[**2726-6-28**] CT Scan: Retrosternal fluid collection is posterior to
the extent of the body of the sternum measuring 21 x 25 x 125 mm
in AP, transverse and sagittal dimensions. A smaller second
retrosternal fluid collection is posterior to the manubrium of
the sternum. A small area of edema and fluid collection is
anterior to the manubrium of the sternum. Small pocket of gas is
incompletely imaged anterior to the trachea seen in the first
three images of the study at the level of the thoracic inlet.
This can be post-operative. There are no air bubbles within the
fluid collections anterior and posterior to the sternum. Native
coronary arteries are calcified.Small-to-moderate bilateral
pleural effusions are greater on the left side. There is a
sliver of pericardial effusion. Patient is post CABG. There is
no mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The pleural effusions are
associated with adjacent atelectasis left greater than right.

[**2726-7-2**] TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
tricuspid valve. No tricuspid regurgitation is seen. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1969**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 22**] on [**2726-6-28**] for further
management of his sternal wound infection. A CT scan was
obtained which was suggestive of a retrosternal fluid
collection. He was pancultured and started on broad spectrum
antibiotics(Ciprofloxacin and Vancomycin) pending culture
results. On [**6-29**], he was brought to the operating room
where sternal debridement was performed with placement of a VAC
dressing. For surgical details, please see operative note. He
was kept sedated and paralyzed for several days and returned to
the operating room on [**7-2**] where sternal closure was
performed with Talon system along with pectoral advancement
flaps by the Plastic surgery team. Operative wound cultures grew
out Proteus mirabilis along with coagulase negative
Staphylococcus. Antibiotics were titrated and adjusted per ID
recommendatioms. Rifampin was eventually added. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 1969**] will
require an 8 week (start [**7-2**]) course of Vanco and rifampin and
possibly lifelong cipro or bactrim to be determined by ID in
follow up. A PICC line was placed on [**7-6**]. The remainder of his
postoperative course was essentially uneventful. He is advised
to follow up with Plastics 2 weeks after discharge to reassess
removal of the remaining JP drain. He continued to progress and
was cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] for discharge on POD #12 with
VNA. All follow up appointments were advised.
