Chief Complaint:
CHEST PAIN AND SHORTNESS-OF-BREATH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Operative treatment of left intertrochanteric hip fracture with
trochanteric femoral nail
- PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
64F with uncontrolled DM, HTN, HLD who presents to the ED with
chief complaint of chest pain and difficulty breathing.  Patient
said that she was in her usual state of health until this
morning.  She was lying on the couch with her granddaughter for
about 1.5 hours dozing in and out of sleep when she suddenly
woke up by a sense of diffuse chills and shaking.  She became
very short of breath and then began to have sharp midline chest
pain over her sternum that radiated over her right breast.  She
also had associated nausea without vomiting.  She became very
concerned and had her daughter call EMD.  According to EMS she
reported a few days of chest pain and back pain. She was found
to have a temp of 101.2 and was hypertensive. EMS reported
bilateral rales as well.  She was brought to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
The patient denies recent fevers, chills, night sweats, URI
symptoms, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary frequency,
dysuria, joints, muscle pains, anxiety or depression.

She does say that she has long history of weeping fluid from her
RLE.  Over the last two weeks, she feels that her RLE has become
slowly increasingly eryhematous, painful to touch and warm.
This has not occurred on the left.  She also feels that it is
weeping more than usual.  She has a long history of being unable
to make it to see her PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) **]clinic and has not
been there since [**3201**].

In the ED, initial VS were: 101.2 120 141/110 30 97% 15L
Non-Rebreather.  Physical exam in the ED (according to signout)
- anxious appearing, tachypnic, tachycardic but RR normal S1S2,
lungs difficult to assess but no obvious wheezing or rales,
bilateral lower extremity edema with weeping on R. Labs
significant for a WBC of 11.2 (N:90.4 L:5.7), lactate of 3.1,
BNP 118, trop <0.01, CXR showed mild right basilar atelectasis
and concern for pleural effusions, given Lasix 20mgx1, Morphine
5mg x1, Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin. IVF running slowly for
tachycardia.

.
CHEST X-RAY ([**3204-3-26**]): A small hazy opacification at the right
base most consistent with atelectasis. No other consolidations
are present. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There
is no pulmonary edema. Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette is unchanged from the prior exams.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild right basilar atelectasis.
2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
CTA CHEST ([**3204-3-26**]): No nodules are seen in the unenhanced
thyroid gland. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without
evidence of intramural hematoma or dissection. Pulmonary
arterial vasculature is visualized to the subsegmental level
without filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism. There is
no axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy. A top normal size
precarinal lymph node measures 1.0 cm in short axis, previously
1.2 cm on [**3203-2-28**] (3:18). The heart is enlarged with moderate
coronary artery calcifications. The pericardium and three-vessel
takeoff are within normal limits aside. There is no pericardial
effusion. A trace right pleural effusion is seen. No left
effusion. Evaluation of the lung fields is limited by motion
artifact, particularly at the lung bases. There is right basilar
atelectasis adjacent to the effusion. Mild left basilar
dependent atelectasis. There is no worrisome nodule, mass or
consolidation. Airways are patent to the subsegmental levels
bilaterally.
This study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. The
visualized portions of the liver, spleen, and kidneys are
unremarkable. Again seen is a right adrenal lesion measuring 2.9
x 3.2 cm, previously 2.7 x 2.9 cm, with attenuation of 5 [**Doctor Last Name **],
compatible with an adenoma.Soft tissue in the left hypochondrium
represents the patients known spelnorenal shunt.
BONE WINDOWS: No bone finding suspicious for infection or
malignancy is seen. Compression deformities in the mid thoracic
spine are unchanged from [**3203-2-28**].
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
2. Left adrenal adenoma is slightly increased in size from
[**3203-2-28**].
.
AP/LATERAL HIP X-RAY ([**3204-3-30**]): There is a comminuted
intertrochanteric fracture of left proximal femur, with slight
varus angulation. There is a separate lesser tuberosity
component. There is an equivocal additional greater tuberosity
component. The hip joint itself is obscured by overlying soft
tissues and underpenetration.
.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY FLOUROSCOPY ([**3204-3-30**]): Fluoroscopic images
of the left hip from the operating room demonstrates interval
placement of a short intramedullary rod with distal interlocking
screw and proximal pin. There is also a minimally displaced
lesser trochanter fracture fragment. The total intraservice
fluoroscopic time was 178.9 seconds. Please refer to the
operative note for additional details.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo F with poorly controlled IDDM, HTN, HLD p/w chest pain and
difficulty breathing, found to have GBS bacteremia and RLE
cellulitis, with course c/b left hip communuted
intertrochanteric fracture and anemia.
.
# GROUP B STREP BACTEREMIA [**1-1**] RLE CELLULITIS: Patient was
febrile with mild leukocytosis and left shift on admission; WBC
increased to max of >20K/mL within 24 hours of admission. Exam
was notable for prominent nonpurulent RLE cellulitis and marked
BLE and dusky appearance, suggesting that an underlying chronic
venous stasis could have contributed to development of
cellulitis. Patient empirically started on Vancomycin in ED. BCx
from [**3204-3-26**] subsequently grew pan-sensitive Group B strep, and
patient was narrowed to Ceftriaxone 2mg IV q12 hours to complete
a total two week course (last day [**3204-4-13**]). Repeat blood
cultures on [**4-19**] and [**3-30**] all returned negative.
.
# DYSPNEA/HYPOXEMIA: On presentation to ED, patient was
initially tachypneic and hypoxemic with O2 sat 94% on 3L. Acuity
of her respiratory symptoms (along with presence of sinus tach
not responsive to IV fluids) was concerning for PE, dissection,
or myocardial ischemia but CTA chest, chest x-ray, EKG and
cardiac enzymes were all reassuring. She briefly required NRB in
ED so was subsequently admitted to ICU and started on standing
nebs. O2 was rapidly weaned and she was called out to the
regular medical floor the next morning. After this her O2 sats
remained stable in high 90s on room air throughout rest of
hospitalization. Ipratropium/albuterol standing nebs were
continued during hospitalization. She will continue albuterol
PRN on discharge.
.
#.COMMINUTED INTERTROCHANTERIC LEFT FEMORAL FRACTURE: On [**3204-3-31**]
patient suffered a mechanical fall and was found to have
comminuted intertrochanteric left femoral fracture. She had
uncomplicated surgical repair by Orthopedic Surgery on [**3-31**] with
placement of left trochanteric femoral nail. Pain management was
provided with IV dilaudid, then tapered to PO oxycodone. She
continued to report poor pain control although per her daughter
she has extremely low threshold for pain and did report severe
pain even before fracturing her hip. On discharge she is
prescribed oxycontin 10mg PO q12 hours and oxycodone 5mg PO q4
hrs PRN breakthrough pain, as well as standing Tylenol 1000mg PO
q8 hrs. For DVT prophylaxis she was started on Lovenox 30mg SC
q12 hours, to be continued for a total of 4 weeks. She will
follow up with Orthopedics for repeat x-rays, suture removal and
examination on [**3204-4-13**].
.
# DM2/HYPERGLYCEMIA: Patient has uncontrolled IDDM; last A1c 9.3
in 1/[**3203**]. Blood glucose was in 400's on admission. UA showed
proteinuria (100) and glucosuria (1000), likely representing
early diabetic nephropathy. She was started on her home Lantus
33units qAM as well as insulin sliding scale, which are to be
continued on discharge to rehab. She will need follow-up insulin
regimen monitoring/diabetes education by PCP/home VNA.
.
# HEPATITIS C: In [**3197**], viral load was 1,230,000 IU/mL. HCV
viral load was rechecked during this hospitalization and is
pending upon discharge.
.
# HYPERTENSION: Normotensive on admission. Continued lisinopril
30mg PO Daily.
.
# VERTIGO: Asymptomatic throughout hospitalization. Continued
home meclizine 12.5mg PO q6 hrs PRN dizziness.
.
# LEFT EYE BLINDNESS: reported by patient and family on
admission; has not seen an ophthalmologist. Significant cataract
apparent on exam. She will need outpatient ophthalmology f/u for
this issue.
