Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization s/p 2 DES

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is an 83 year-old woman with HTN, Hyperlipidemia
who was getting pain with exertion in her left chest for the
past year, worse for the past 2-3 months. Also increasing DOE
after exterion, stress. Stress test done 2 months ago showed
fixed inferior posterior perfusion defect with EF 64% and
upsloping ST depressions -- Patient developed exhaustion and
substernal chest discomfort after walking only a short distance
on the treadmill ([**2711-9-13**]). Patient delayed cath until now. On
ROS, denied abdominal pain, urinary complaints. Reports
occasional DOE, occasional PND.
.
Cath on [**2711-11-22**] showed Right Dominant System with 2 vessel
disease: diffusely diseased RCA with 90% mid-RCA stenosis, 70%
proximal Cx stenosis, and 50% mid-Cx stenosis --> DES to RCA,
DES to LCX. Given history of possible aspirin allergy (patient
broke out in hives several years ago after taking Alleve and was
told by an alergist that she should avoid ASA), patient was
admitted to CCU for desensitization while under Integrillin and
Plavix therapy.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization [**2711-11-22**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant patient

revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
normal.  The
LAD had diffuse minor disease.  The LCx had a proximal ulcerated
70%
lesion and a proximal OM1 lesion of 50%.  The RCA had a tight
mid 90%
lesion.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a blood pressure of
186/74
with mean of 102 which was treated with nitro drip.
3. Successful placement of 2.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent
in
mid-RCA postdilated with a 2.75 mm balloon. Final angiography
demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
4. Successful placement of 3.0 x 8 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent
in
proximal LCx. Final angiography demonstrated no residual
stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA
Comments).
5. Aspirin desensitization in the intensive care unit today.
6. Successful placement of 6 French Angioseal device in right
femoral
arteriotomy without complications.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel CAD
2. Moderate severe systemic hypertension.
3. Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in mid-RCA.
4. Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in proximal LCx.
5. Successful placement of Angioseal in right femoral
arteriotomy.
6. Aspirin desensitization today in intensive care unit.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 83 year-old female with HTN, Hypercholesterolemia,
and recent +Myoview ([**8-21**]) who was admitted for cardiac
catheterization. Patient was taken to the catheterization
laboratory where 2 vessel CAD was seen. Patient received 2 drug
eluting stents to RCA and LCx, respectively (see Pertinent
Results section for full details); she tolerated procedure well.
Given history of Aspirin allergy, patient was subsequently
admitted to the CCU for staged desensitization. Patient was
successfully desensitized and outpatient medications were
restored. Patient to continue ASA indefinitely and Plavix for
minimum 6 months. Patient was discharged home the following day
on her routine medications to follow-up with her PCP and
cardiologist.
