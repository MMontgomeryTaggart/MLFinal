TWO-VIEW CHEST, [**3020-2-12**]

COMPARISON: [**3020-2-9**].

INDICATION: Left lower lobe opacity.

The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery
bypass surgery. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in
the post-operative period. There is a resolving area of opacity
in the left lower lobe with residual patchy and linear opacity
remaining. Small pleural effusions are seen bilaterally on the
lateral projection.

IMPRESSION: Resolving left lower lobe opacity, most likely
atelectasis.

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.3 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1

Aorta - Arch: 0.0 cm (nl <= 3.0 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the
RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.


LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%).

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior
- normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal
anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal
aortic arch diameter. Focal calcifications in descending aorta.


AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.


MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
appears to be
in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Post-Bypasss:
Normal left ventricular systolic function. EF 55%. Ascending
aorta looks
similar to prebypass period.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8658**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 22**] on [**3020-2-7**] for further
management of his chest pain and and shortness of breath. His
catheterization at [**Hospital1 22**] revealed significant 3 vessel disease
with a preserved LVEF.  Please see catheterization report for
details.  Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac
surgical service was consulted for surgical revascularization.
He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner.  On [**3020-2-7**]
he successfully underwent CABGx3 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM, SVG->PDA).
 He was taken back to the operating room for reexploration and
clot evacuation after having 400cc of bloody drainage out of his
chest tubes and a normal coagulation panel.  Hemostasis was
acheived and he was reclosed.  Afterward he was transferred to
the Cardiac surgery recovery unit in stable condition and
awakened neurologically intake.  He was weaned from ventilator
support and extubated.  On POD 2 his pressors were weaned.  His
chest tubes were removed without complication.  He was gently
diuresed to his preoperative weight, beta blockade and aspirin
therapy were resumed, and physical therapy service was consulted
to assist with his postoperative strength and mobility.
Electrolytes were repleted as needed.  On POD 3 He was
transfused  one unit of PRBC's for a HCT of 22.5.  He was then
transferred to the Stepdown unit for further recovery.  On POD 4
his epicardial pacing wires were removed without complication,
he continued to improve his ability to ambulate.  On POD 5 Mr.
[**Known patient lastname 8658**] had made steady progress in his ability to ambulate
however his resting heart rate remained in the 90's for which is
lopressor was increased.  His SBP dropped into the mid 90's with
ambulation up stairs.  On POD6  He was had improved his exercise
tolerance, and denied SOB or Chest pain.  His blood pressure was
stable.  His sternotomy and leg incision were clean, dry, and
intact without evidence of infection. Discharged delayed until
pt. had a BM. He was discharged home on POD 7 with services in
good condition, cardiac diet, sternal precautions, and
instructed to follow up with his PCP/cardiologist in [**11-22**] weeks.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 259**] in four weeks.
