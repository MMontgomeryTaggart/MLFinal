Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 137**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital1 70**] for NSTEMI, cardiogenic and septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Insertion of central venous catheter

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 58 male with h/o CAD s/p MI, DM2, HTN, atrial fibrillation,
morbid obesity presented to [**Hospital 70**] Hospital with 2-3 days of
productive cough and hemoptysis. He was found to be in
significant respiratory distress, and BiPAP was initiated. He
then became agitated and confused, and he required intubation
with ABG of 7.23/61/66. He then became hypotensive and had
decreased urine output (despite agressive diuresis). He was
eventually started on levophed and neosynephrine, with propofol
for sedation. His CXR was read as an infiltrate; his BNP was
>1100; his cardiac enzymes were elevated, and there were no ST
elevations on his ECG. He was given [**Hospital **], plavix 300, mucomyst,
and moxifloxacin x 1, and transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] for presumed
cardiogenic shock, NSTEMI, and emergent catheterization.
.
ROS: Per his family, he has had a productive cough for several
weeks, and increasing dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and PND.
He did not complain of any chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, or urinary symptoms. He has had chronic diarrhea since
starting metformin (which has been stopped), and may have been
worse recently. He also complained of intermittent headaches.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 22**] he was taken emergently to the cardiac
catheterization lab, where he was found to have three vessel
disease (LM 40-50%; LAD 95% prox/mid; LCx subtotal plaque; RCA
mid 60% and distal 80%. There were no interventions done on the
coronary arteries (felt that the LCx occlusion was old). His
pressures were: RA 29; RV 86/12; PA 74/40; PCW 28; CO 8.7; CI
2.9. A balloon pump was inserted.
.
On arrival to the CCU he was intubated, sedated, with swan ganz
catheter in his right groin, balloon pump through his left
groin.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel disease. The LMCA had an eccentric 50% distal
plaque
extending into the origin of the LCX. The LAD was diffusely
diseased
throughout with a complex, uclerated 95% stenosis in the mid
vessel with
TIMI3 flow. The LCX was a severely diffusely diseased vessel
that was
subtotally occluded proximally. The RCA was a dominant vessel
with an
ulcerated 60% stenosis in the mid vessel and an 80% stenosis in
a
diminutive rPL branch.
2. Resting hemodunamics revealed severely elevated right and
left sided
filling pressures (mRAP 27 mmHg, mPCW 38 mmHg). There was severe

pulmonary arterial hypertension (mPAP 50 mmHg). The cardiac
index was
normal (2.9 l/m/m2).
3. Successful placement of a 40cc intraaortic balloon pump.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
4. Successful balloon pump placement.
.
TEE:
.
Conclusions:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the anterior wall. The remainder of the
walls contract well although the apex is not fully visualized
(estimated ejection fraction ?45%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal in suboptimal views. There
are complex (>4mm) non-mobile atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but no aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Anterior wall hypokinesis with overall probably
mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function (with IABP
support). No significant valvular disease. Complex, non-mobile
atheroma in descending aorta.
.
INITIAL CXR:
.
Two radiographs of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube
with its tip at the level of the clavicular heads. Cardiac size
is not well assessed secondary to portable technique, but there
is probably mild cardiomegaly. There is a nasogastric tube
present with its tip in the stomach. Assessment of the pulmonary
parenchyma is limited by patient rotation and position. No
consolidation is evident. No pleural effusion is detected.
Trachea is midline.
.
IMPRESSION:
.
Satisfactory placement of endotracheal tube.
.
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 35% to 40% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated during the
procedure. He was on 1 mg/hr IV of midazolam, and 25mcg/hr for
sedation, which was continued during the procedure. The patient
was receiving IABP support during the procedure. The descending
thoracic aorta was not well visualized due to the presence of
the IABP.
.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA.  Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.
.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Mild-moderate
regional LV systolic dysfunction.
.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.

.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3480**]
throughout the procedure. No TEE related complications. The
rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation. Based on [**2845**] AHA
endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended). Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data. Results were reviewed with
the Cardiology Fellow involved with the patient's care.
Echocardiographic results were reviewed with the houseofficer
caring for the patient. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
The proximal balloon tip is positioned distal to the takeoff of
the left subclavian.

BRIEF HISTORY:   Mr [**Known patient lastname 10023**] presents for coronary
revascularization.
He presented two weeks ago in  shock presumed to be due to
sepsis, with
a possible contribution from CHD. His angiogram at that time
showed
three vessel disease. Since then he has been intubated and had
difficulty in weaning off. He is also morbidly obese, has
diabetes and
AF. He subsequently developed HIT and has been treated with
Argatroban
iv. His echocardiogram showed an EF of 40-45% with anterior
hypokinesia.

PTCA COMMENTS:     The angiogram showed a diffusely diseased
proximal/mid LAD with a 80-90% lesion through which the D1
arose. The CX
was completely occluded woth collateralisation. The mid RCA had
an
eccentric 60-70% lesion. We planned to treat these lesions using

[**Last Name (LF) 10024**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and Plavix prophylactically and starting with
the CX.
(He has a h/o HIT) A 8F XB 4.5 guide provided adeqaute support.
We then
crossed in to the distal CX with a PT [**Name (NI) **] IM wire with
minimal
difficulty and performed serial multiple dilations using a 1.5 X
09mm
Maveick and a 2.0 X 15mm  Voyager balloon at 9-12 atm. This
resulted in
TIMI III flow, mild dissection and a 30% residual stenosis with
no
embolisation.
.
We then turned our attention to the LAD. The lesion was crossed
using a
Prowater wire with some difficulty and predilated with a 2.0 X
20mm
(inflated up to 14-18atm) and a 2.5 X 20mm Sprinter ( infalted
up to
[**1-14**] atm) balloons from distal to proximal lesion. We then
deployed a
2.5 X 28mm and a 3.0 X 18mm Cypher stent at 20 atm and 18 atm
from
distal to proximal resepectively. This jailed the D1 causing a
non flow
limiting 70% lesions. The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow,
no
residual stenosis, no dissection or embolisation in the stented
segement.
.
We then turned our attention to the RCA. A 8F JR 4 guide
provided
adequate support. A prowater wire crossed in to the distal
vessel
easily.We then directly deployed a 3.5 X 13mm cypher stent at 18
atm.
the final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual
stenosis, no
dissection and no embolisation. the patient left the lab in a
stable
condition.

COMMENTS:
1. The LCX total occlusion was angioplastied with a 1.5 X 09mm
Maverick
and 2.0 X 15mm Voyager balloons with lesion reduction from 100%
to 30%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow, 30% diffuse residual
stenosis,
mild dissection and no embolisation. (see PTCA comments)
.
2. The proximal LAD lesion was predilated with a 2.0 X 20mm and
a 2.5 X
20mm Sprinter balloon and stented with a 2.5 X 28mm and a 3.0 X
18mm
Cypher stent in an overlapping manner with lesion reduction from
90% to
0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual
stenosis
in the stented segment with no dissection or embolisation. The
jailed D1
had an ostial stenosis of 70% severity with no flow limitation.
(see
PTCA comments)
.
3. the mid RCA lesion was directly stented with a 3.5 X 13mm
Cypher
stent with lesion reduction from 70% to 0% The final angiogram
showed
TIMI III flow with no dissection or embolisation. (see PTCA
comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly impaired ventricular function.
3. Successful balloon angioplasty of the proximal LCX
4. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD
5. Successful stenting of the mid RCA
.
[**5-29**] CXR:
FINDINGS: There is stable cardiomegaly. Pulmonary edema pattern
seen on the prior radiographs is essentially unchanged. Left
retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is
stable in appearance.

IMPRESSION:
No significant change.


Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION/PLAN: 58 morbidly obese male with h/o CAD, HTN, DM2,
hypercholesterolemia presenting with hypotension/sepsis due to
infection and cardiogenic, respiratory failure, fever, NSTEMI
[**5-2**] , acute renal failure now s/p trach/PEG [**5-18**] for
OSA/obesity/pulmonary hypertension, s/p LAD DESx2, RCA - DES,
LCx s/p baloon on [**5-19**], being transfered for further pulmonary
rehab.
.
HYPOTENSION: Initially felt to be combination of septic and
cardiogenic shock. Patient was found to be with decreased
cardiac index as well as elevated leukocytosis. Cardiac index
and output soon returned to [**Location 10025**]. Patient's IABP was
discontinued. Patient was also titrated offf levophed adn
vasopressin over 3 days with MAPs > 60. For septic component
patient presented with several weeks of diarrhea, cough and then
hemoptysis thus PNA was felt to be most likely course of
infection. Patient was empirically treated for VAP, initially
levo/azithro. His sputum on [**5-4**] grew out MRSA and vanco was
added. He remained febrile and antibiotics were switched to
vanc/ctx/azithro, then vanc/cefepime, then switched to
aztreonam/linezolid for suspected drug fever/rash, completing
10d course on [**5-14**]. His rash improved and vanco and cefepime
were deemed to be potential allergens. Patient was also
subsequent found to have C. Diff ([**5-6**]) and was started on
Flagyl, he completed 14 day course on [**5-21**]. Patient was also
found to be bacteremic after he grew out [**2-4**] BCx on [**5-19**] that
showed MRSA.  Patient was treated with Linezolid because of his
presumed rash to vancomycin.  He is to complete 14 day course.
Patient's sputum was also positive for MRSA with moderate growth
which may be a chronic colonizer but 2 week course should be
more than adequate for ventilator associated pneumonia and
excellent lung penetration with linezolid.  Patient had his R
Scl line subsequently resited on [**5-21**].  His lines were d/c upon
discharge.  He remained afebrile 48 hours prior to discharge.
Patient was also treated with a 7 day course of Aztreonam that
finished on [**5-27**].  Patient remained normotensive through the
rest of the course and tolerated his beta blocker and his ace
well.
.
ATRIAL FIB: Patient with chronic history with persistent AF.
Patient was initially started on amiodarone and digoxin for rate
control. He was loaded and then switched to amiodarone PO. He
was also started on heparin drip for anticoagulation. Patient
was subsequently found to be thrombocytopenic and with + Heparin
antibody. His anticoagulation was switched to argatroban. His
course was also complicated by bradycardic AF to 30s without BP
compromise. His digoxin and amiodarone were d/c and patient
recovered to 60s. He was slowly restarted on low dose beta
blocker and remained in 60s as his beta blocker was titrated up.
 Patient was also restarted on coumadin with a goal INR of [**3-6**]
and he needs his coumadin dose to be adjusted based on weekly
INRs to be followed by his PCP.
.
RESP FAILURE: Patient CXR initially showed with diffuse
pulmonary edema. His failure was attributed to both septic and
cardiac failure and he was found to have Vent Associated
Pneumonian afterwards. Patient was oxygenating well after
aggressive diuresis. His oxygenation status also improved.
Patient however still required high PEEPs. Patient has a
compromised pulmonary status at baseline and is followed by a
pulmonologist as an outpatient and was electively being
evaluated for a tracheaostomy due to sleep apnea, pulmonary
hypertension and obesity hypoventilation. Patient previously did
not tolerated CPAP at night. Pulmonary service was consulted
after patient failed spontaneous breathing trials and after 2
weeks on ventilator, a tracheostomy was recommended. Patient
subsequently underwent PEG and Tracheostomy placement on [**5-19**] by
Minimally Invasive Surgery. Patient tolerating the procedure
well without complications. His sedation with fentanyl and
versed was subsequently weaned and he was further diuresed.
Patient was doing well on trach mask during the day requring
40-50% FiO2.  He was rested at night with CPAP of [**11-5**]. [**2854-5-29**]
had an acute desaturation requiring pulmonary toilet, suctioning
and replacement on A/C for the rest of the evening. [**2854-5-30**] he
was placed on CPAP and Sunday was again on trach collar doing
well. Thought patient had aspirated but his white count remained
stable and CXR was w/o infiltrates. Patient is to follow up with
his pulmonologist and to undergo aggressive pulmonary rehab.
The ultimate goal of tracheostomy reversal may be difficult to
achieve.
.
NSTEMI: Patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes
during his hospital course. Peak CK was 1766 and peak troponin T
was 2.95. His EKG initially did not show any ischemic changes
and remained with AF and incomplete RBBB. He was taken to
Cardiac Cath upon transfer on [**5-2**] and was found to have diffuse
3 vessel disease. CT surgery was consulted and recommended
further stabilization medically of this diabetic, septic,
hypotensive patient with ? of demand infarct and acute renal
failure. After 2 weeks patient was also re-evaluated but with
heparin antibody and intermittent pressor requirement he was
deemed to be high risk. Patient was then taken to the cath lab
for LAD intervention. He was continued on aspirin, statin,
plavix, heparin and then argatroban drip and beta blocker and
ace were restarted.
Patient was taken bath to cath lab on [**5-19**] where his LAD was
stented with 2 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) 608**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], DES in RCA and baloon angioplasty in
LCx.  The procedure was without complications.  Patient remained
chest pain free.
.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Patient's baseline was unknown. He was
admitted with Cr of 3.0 but with good urine output. His urine
lytes revealed a pre-renal state. They slowly improved to 1.5
and were deeemed likely to be due to hypoperfusion. There may
have also been an element of contrast nephropathy despite
receing mycomyst and prehydration with bicarbonate. Renal US
([**5-2**]) was also normal.  Patient remained with good urine output.
 He tolerated diuresis well with lasix prn and lasix gtt.  His
Cr returned to his baseline of 1.1.
.
PUMP: Echo [**5-6**]: 45% EF, anterior hypokinesis, no valvular
abnormalities.  Patient tolerated diuresis well. Patient was
continued on BB and AceI as they were titrated up.
.
DM-2: cont ISS, patient may be able to return to oral
hypoglycemic upon his discharge home.
.
HEPARIN INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA: After several days on IV
