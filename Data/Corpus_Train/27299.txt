Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4238**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI s/p PCI w/stent x2 to RCA c/b cardiac arrest, IABP, and
intubated

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
83yo F w/poorly controlled HTN (LVH), longstanding diabetes,
dyslipidemia, renal insufficiency, s/p recent laminectomy on
[**3130-4-26**]. During pre-op evaluation had an unremarkable Dobutamine
ECHO on [**4-19**]. Post operative course c/b ischemic symptoms, CP,
ECG changes-acute inferolateral downsloping ST depressions, and
+CE. CK 500S, MB +3.8, Tn-T 7.67 then 37. In setting of being
48hours post op from laminectomy, she did not receive heparin.
She received ASA, Nitrates, IV lopressor and underwent a
diagnostic cath at NEBH. Cath showed R-dominant systed with 3VD.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] for further intervention. She
received 3 UPRBC for anemia at NEBH.
.
On arrival to Cath lab she received Plavix 300mg. During Cath
found 99%RCA Mid/moderate proximal with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) 608**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] x2 to RCA.
During LAD injection with dye pt went into Asystole, CPR was
initiated, gave Atropine 1mg x1, Epi 1mgx1 and placed IABP
followed by intubation for airway protection. LAD w/acute
occlusion possibly due to vasospasm vs. embolic event as LAD was
found to be patent without requiring stent placement immediately
after this transient event. She then received [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) 608**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] stent
to L-Cx. Pt underwent TTE in holding area w/EF 40-45%, 1+AR,
2+TR, 1+MR, Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
to moderately depressed with akinesis of the infero-lateral wall
and hypokinesis of the inferior wall. She received Lasix 40mg IV
x1 and was sent to the CCU for further management.

.
ECHO [**4-28**] Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly to moderately depressed with akinesis of the
infero-lateral wall and hypokinesis of the inferior wall. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation. No pericardial effusion.
.
[**4-30**] Renal U/S IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Simple
cysts in both kidneys.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Asessment: 83 yo F s/p NSTEMI w/3VD on cath, s/p PCI to RCA and
Cx, c/b transient occlusion of LAD [**1-16**] embolic event, s/p
intubation and IABP placement
.
# CARDIOVASCULAR
  1. CAD: s/p revascularization (see HPI).  We continued ASA,
Plavix, Beta Blocker and started high dose statin.  ACE was held
n the setting of ARF (see below).  We cycled CE until peak
Troponin of 4.32 and CK of 689 (index peak was 5.1).  Upon
arrival in CCU, we discontinued Nitro gtt, norvasc, and witheld
hep gtt and integrellin (s/p recent back surgery).  Her IABP was
discontinued on HD #1.  Her BB was temporarily held for low BP
(SBP 80s-90s) but this resolved on HD #1.  An echocardiogram
showed EF 40-45% with 1+ AI and 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  There was
inferolateral Akinesis and Inferior Hypokinesis.  While she
experienced some back pain, she denied CP throughout the
admission.
.
  2. PUMP: TTE w/EF 40-45%, hypotension during cath requiring
IABP.  We weaned IABP to off (d/c'd IABP [**4-28**]).  Given 2+MR, we
afterload reduced with gentle diuresis and monitored
hemodynamics carefully.  BPs were transiently low on HD #1 but
resolved.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: PT arrested during cath (PEA arrest),
requiring CPR and intubation for airway protection.  Infiltrate
on CXR was thought to be possible aspiration PNA, so we started
Clinda on [**4-28**] (planned 7 day course).  She was gently diuresis
with lasix prn.  On HD #1, she was extubated without event after
a successful ventillator wean.  She remained off the ventillator
throughout the duration of the admission and required minimal
(2L) Nasal Cannula by day of transfer.
.
#. RENAL: Underlying renal insufficiency possibly from HTN and
DM.  She subsequently developed ARF thought to be secondary to
ATN with low urine output and a bump in her creatinine with a
peak of 3.9 2 days prior to transfer and a BUN of 43 at that
time.  We avoided nephrotoxin meds, renally dosed all meds and
stopped her Ace-inhibitor and held diuretics in the setting of
ARF.  A renal ultrasound was normal (no hydronephrosis).  Urine
lytes were consistent with a low FENa.  Renal consulted and
considered her ARF secondary to contrast nephropathy.
.
#. HEMATURIA: pt received 3UPRBC at OSH for anemia, unclear
whether anemia secondary to hematuria.  Cytology was sent and is
pending at time of transfer.  She received 1 unit of PRBCs on
[**4-29**] for a HCT of 30 but this has since stabilized in the low
30s.
.
#. BACK PAIN:  She had pain throughout the admission,  She is
s/p recent laminectomy.  Ortho-spine conulted and stated that
unless she had increased pain below the knee of headache,
MR/Lspine was not necessary.  PT followed but she was too
deconditioned during this admission to ambulate.
.
#. RASH:  Pt had a rash s/p percocet.  This was switched to
Dilauded and the rash resolved.
.
#. DM: Held oral hypoglycemic meds, ISS and FS during this
admission.
.
#. PPX: Hep SC, PPI
