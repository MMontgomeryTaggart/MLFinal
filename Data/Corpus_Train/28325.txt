CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate pleural effusions

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old man s/p CABGx4
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate pleural effusions
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient after recent
CABG.

PA and lateral upright chest radiographs compared to [**2648-9-27**] and [**2648-9-24**] (pre-operative examination).

The cardiomediastinal contours is stable post-operatively. The
right internal jugular line has been removed. The bibasilar
retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged. The bilateral pleural
effusion is small, left more than right, slightly increased on
the left. The previously demonstrated bilateral pleural plaques
are unchanged. There is no evidence of congestive heart failure.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable cardiomediastinal post-operative appearance.
2. Slightly increased left pleural effusion, still small size.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:

1. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%).
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis
of the inferior wall. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The
non-coronary cusp
is heavily calcified with restricted systolic motion. However,
there is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. .

POST-BYPASS:

1. There is regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of
the inferior wall.
2. The estimated LVEF may be slightly improved from pre-bypass.

3. There is mild eccendtric tricuspid regurgitation
4. The aortic contours are intact
4. The remaining exam is unchanged
5. All results discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 13541**] was referred for cardiac catherization [**2648-9-22**]
which found left main and 2 vessel CAD.  He was medically
managed and preoperative workup completed.  On [**2648-9-25**] he was
taken to the operating room and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a coronary
artery bypass graft surgery, see operative report for further
details. He was tranferred to the CSRU.  Sedation was weaned off
and he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He was
weaned from his vasoactive drips and transferred to the floor by
POD #2. He continued to do well postoperatively, easily
diuresed, and no atrial dysrhythmias.  He was ready for
discharge on post operative day 6 with VNA services.
