Reason: ? ascites, ? patency of vesselsplease assess with
dopplers

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old man with ESLD, encephalopathy
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? ascites, ? patency of vesselsplease assess with dopplers
ULTRASOUND OF THE LIVER

CLINICAL INDICATION: End-stage liver disease, encephalopathy,
assess for ascites and patency of liver vessels.

COMPARISON STUDY: [**2979-7-2**].

The liver is grossly abnormal in architecture with a nodular
pattern and a markedly irregular capsular surface. While no
discrete hepatic masses are seen, the derangement of
architecture is so severe that the sensitivity for detection of
liver lesions is markedly diminished. There is a markedly
enlarged spleen measuring at least 18 cm in length, and there is
also evidence of large volume of ascites. Portal vein is patent
but there is hepatofugal flow in the right portal system and
flow in the left portal vein is hepatopetal and exits the liver
via a huge patent umbilical vein collateral.

Pancreas and retroperitoneum are not well seen. There are no
gallstones identified nor is there evidence of bile duct
dilatation. There may be some sludge in the dependent portion of
the gallbladder. Limited views of the kidneys show no obvious
hydronephrosis.

CONCLUSION: Severe cirrhosis and portal hypertension with large
patent umbilical vein and massive splenomegaly. The liver
architecture is markedly deranged and ultrasound is therefore
insensitive for detection of focal liver lesions, although no
masses can be identified. Large volume ascites is also noted.
Portions of the right and middle hepatic veins are visualized
and are patent.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: infiltrate, edema

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old man with hypotension
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
infiltrate, edema
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Hypertension in patient with known
cirrhosis.

The lungs are low. The heart size is slightly enlarged compared
to [**2979-3-10**] which may be partially explained by low lung
volumes. The bibasal crowdness of the vessels is more pronounced
in the left base where developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.
The upper lungs are unremarkable. The biapical attenuation of
the lung vessels might represent emphysema. Small left pleural
effusion cannot be excluded.

IMPRESSION: Questionable left lower lobe pneumonia. Repeated
radiograph in upright position including the lateral view was
reccommended for precise evaluation of LLL findings and
questionable increase in the heart size.
Findings were discussed with Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1408**] at the time of dictation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Encephalopathy - Patient was thought to have hepatic
encephalopathy, complicated  renal failure with mild uremia, and
possible infection of unknown source. There was also a question
of lactulose non-compliance as well as possible other
ingestions. Patient's mental status initially cleared, at which
point he was able to clearly state his wishes to be DNR/DNI, and
was able to state the meaning of that choice and express it to
his family as well. During his second admission to the MICU,
after a family meeting, the decision was made to transition care
to comfort measures only, given patient's desires as well as
overall poor prognosis.  His encephalopathy was efractory to
lactulose/rifaxamine administration.
.
His acidosis, renal failure, and encephalopathy were no longer
addressed, as prior plan outlined below.
.
The following represent a list of his current active problems at
the time he expired.
.
- Acidosis: combination of volum depletion and failure to clear
exogenous lactate admin or endogenous lactate production from
hypotension.
.
- Renal Failure: concern for evolving hepatorenal syndrome
.
- Hypotension: multifactorial. concern for infectious cause
.
CODE STATUS: Family meeting was held after evaluation by MICU
team during second admission on to MICU. Patient's family
decided that comfort should be goals of care and their wishes
will be followed. The patient was lucid and of sound mind on
admit [**10-13**] and wished then to be DNR/DNI, with comfort as the
goals of care. This wish was followed after re-admission to the
MICU, by the patient's family, HCP and patient.
.
At that time, all medications except those for pain control and
comfort were discontinued. The patient passed away on [**2979-10-20**].
