Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1430**]
Chief Complaint:
Anterior non-ST elevation myocardial infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath with PCI to the proximal LAD with DES.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 13958**] is a 38 year old male with no significant medical
history, no smoking history, no drug history and no family
history has had intermittent [**5-13**] substernal chest pressure over
the last two weeks brought on by exercise and relieved by rest.
Yesterday evening at 6PM the patient experienced [**8-13**] left-sided
substernal chest pressure radiating up his jaw and down his left
arm with associated nausea that was not relieved by rest. He did
not take any medication to relieve the pain. The pain remained
constant throughout the night and he went to the [**Location (un) **] ER at
10AM the next morning. He received an aspirin and SL NTG x 1
from the ED that relieved his chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes were
drawn but could not be read due to the level of lipids in his
blood sample. EKG shows q's in V1-V2 and some ST elev in V2.
Deep T waves in 1, AVL, hyperacute T's inferioly. Patient was
given plavix 600, and started on ntg gtt at 14mcg/min, aggrastat
bolus of 22cc/hr and gtt at 11/hr, heparin bolus of 6000U and
gtt at 1300/hr. Patient was then transfered to [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac
cath.
.
Cardiac cath showed a 99% lesion in the proximal LAD that
underwent successful PCI with a DES.  Distal LAD had diffuse
disease and there were 40% occlusions in D1 and D2.

Past Medical History:
MVA in [**3293**]: patient received a metal plate in the skull

Social History:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 13958**] works as a construction worker and lives with his
wife and four children in [**Name (NI) 13959**], MA. He denies tobacco use and
illegal drug use and drinks 3 beers a week.

Family History:
1. Father: 59 with no history of MI but on lipitor for high
lipids
2. Mother: 59 with no history of MI
3. 2 brothers: no medical history

ECHO on [**3311-10-6**]:
EF=35%
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Prominent
Eustachian valve
(normal variant).
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT
gradient. No LV mass/thrombus.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid anterior - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; anterior apex -
akinetic; septal apex - hypo; apex - hypo;
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**3302**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis
recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk
(prophylaxis not recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the
need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypo/akinesis of
the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall. The
apex is near akinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD (mid-LAD
lesion).

[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:

CATH REPORT ON [**3311-10-5**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
with
patent LMCA and mild disease in the RCA and LCX. The LAD had a
proximal
thrombotic 99% lesion right before the trifurcation with two
large
diagonal vessels.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assesment showed mildy elevated left and right
sided
filling pressures.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting was performed of the mid LAD
with a
3.0x18 mm Cypher Rx stent which was postdilated with a 3.5 mm
balloon.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection,
and TIMI
3 flow.  (see PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
 PTCA of LAD vessel.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with a drug
eluting
stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Rabbit is a 38 year-old male with no past medical history
who presents with a NSTEMI that underwent successful PCI to the
proximal LAD with a DES.
.
#. Cardiovascular:
Patient had a NSTEMI with PCI to LAD.  Patient did well
post-cath with no complications.  His CPK peaked at 653 which
was his initial [**Location (un) 615**].  His lipids were 585/T, [**3288**]/Tri,
81/HDL, 52/LDL ([**Last Name (un) 2977**]).  He was given an 18 hour course of
aggrostat post-cath and he was started on a daily aspirin,
plavix, toprol xl 75mg qd, lisinopril 5mg qd, lipitor 80mg qd
and gemfibrozil 600mg [**Hospital1 **].  His post-cath echo showed an
ejection fraction of 35% with moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, severe hypo/akinesis of the distal half of
the anterior septum and anterior wall and an akinetic apex.  He
did not show any signs or symptoms of heart failure including
extended neck veins, orthopnea or PND.  He was cleared by PT and
was ambulating in the [**Doctor Last Name **] prior to arrival.  Due to his
akinetic apex, he was started on coumadin 5mg qhs with a lovenox
bridge for mural thrombus prophylaxis.  INR prior to d/c was 1.2
and his PTT was 101.6.  He should be anticoagulated for 6 months
or as directed by his new cardiologist.
.
#. Social work: Patient was seen by a social worker.  [**Name (NI) **] does
not have insurance and cannot afford his health care.  He was
set up under Free Care and will be followed up in the [**Hospital 1337**]
Health Care Center starting [**10-19**].  His medications will
be covered under free care.  The patient has an appointment on
[**10-13**] here with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13960**] to monitor his coumadin
therapy until his first appointment at the community health
center in [**Hospital1 1337**].  He also has an appointment with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
the [**Last Name (STitle) **] clinic.
