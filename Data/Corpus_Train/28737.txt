Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6294**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for post cardiac arrest evaluation.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Inplantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placement
Intubation and extubation
Central venous line
PICC line placed and removed

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 64 year-old woman with a history of idiopathic
cardiomopathy who presents on transfer after cardiac arrest.

Per OSH discharge summary, patient presented after found by her
boyfriend at home with unresponsiveness after hearing a thump.
911 was called immediately and when EMS arrived (~5 minutes
after arrest) they patient was noted to be in vfib, apneic and
pulseless.  CPR, ALCS (shock x4) and intubation were perfomed.
At the OSH ED, patient was noted to be in sinus.  Based on EMS
records, time between initial rhythm and 4th (successful) shock
was ~9 minutes.

OSH course:  Evaluated by cardiology.  Noted to have troponin
peak of 0.30. A TTE was performed and showed an LVEF of 30%
(unchanged from prior).  To work-up an elevated WBC (13.4), a
chest CT was done and showed extensive multifocal pulmonary
opacities involving most of the LLL aand portions of the upper
lobes. She was treated with vancomycin, unasyn and azithromycin.


Regarding her neurologic status, patient was noted to be
unresponsive after admission (no purposeful movementswith
sluggish pupils) with a head CT being grossly normal.

The patient's hematocrit was noted to drop from 30.8 on
admission to 25.5 so a unit of pRBC was transfused.

three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious

EMS tracings:  Ventricular fibrillation with NSR initiated after
fourth shock.

ECG ([**3057-11-23**]): NSR at 89. LBBB.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**7-29**]): 1. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with
some preservation of basal inferior and basal lateral wall
motion.
2. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

CARDIAC CATH ([**7-29**]):
1. No angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery
disease.
2. Normal left and right sided filling pressures.
3. Depressed LV function of 30% with global hypokinesis.

TTE ([**11-24**]): The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with
somre preserved contraction of the basal inferolateral and
anterolateral walls. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Global left ventricular cardiomyopathy. Moderate
diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3055-8-23**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased. Estimated
pulmonary artery pressures are elevated (previously
undetermined).

EEG ([**11-26**]): Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and
disorganized
background. This indicates a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications,
metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common
causes.
There were no prominent focal abnormalities, but
encephalopathies may
obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform features. The

background was not at all flat or markedly suppressed, findings
that
might be associated with continued Propofol use or with a severe
anoxic
encephalopathy. Those are still possible causes of the
encephalopathy,
but they are less likely, and the EEG is not strongly suggestive
of
them.

MRI head ([**11-27**]): The FLAIR and T2 as well as diffusion images
demonstrate increased signal in both thalami. There is no
evidence of restricted diffusion seen without evidence of
abnormalities on the ADC map. These findings could be indicative
of subacute changes of hypoxia. Bilateral chronic lacunes
identified. Changes of small vessel disease are seen in the pons
and in the periventricular region. There is moderate
ventriculomegaly without significant sulcal prominence. There
are no chronic blood products seen.
IMPRESSION: Signal changes bilaterally in the thalami without
evidence of
restricted diffusion are likely due to subacute changes from
hypoxic event. Moderate ventriculomegaly is seen. No mass effect
or signs of herniation seen. Mild mucosal thickening in the
sinuses.

Shoulder X-ray ([**11-29**]): Single view of the right shoulder shows
no fracture, dislocation, or subluxation of the shoulder and the
adjacent ribs are intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
64F with female with DM, htn, and history of idiopathic
cardiomyopathy presenting on transfer after vfib arrest.

# Ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest:  The patient received
4 shocks in the field and was in sinus rhythm at the OSH.  Here
she remaiend in sinus rhythm without further arrhythmia.  Her
carvedilol was increased to 25 mg po bid.  After her other
medical issues improved (as below) she had a dual chamber ICD
placed on [**11-2**].  She received 1 mg IV vanc and 1 gm cefazolin
prior to placement and will need to complete three days of
cefalexin for to prevent infection post placement.  She has a
follow up appointment scheduled with the device clinic.

# Neurologic function:  The patient suffered a cardiac arrest
and was initally intubated on transfer.  She was extubated after
9 days on the ventilator and one failed extubation attempt
earlier in the hospital stay.  While on the ventilator and after
extubation she initally has some agitation, but this decreased
as her mental status cleared and she continued to gain
neurologic function.  She has been working with PT, OT, and
speech therapy.  She has been getting 1 mg po haldol at night to
decrease nighttime agitation, and 0.5 mg po ativan for insomnia
if she cannot sleep after the haldol.  As she improves, this can
likely be stopped.  She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.

# Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure:  The patient has
a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 30%.  Per
her PCP she has class II heart failure.  She underwent a TTE
which showed an EF of 30% and  global left ventricular
cardiomyopathy with moderate diastolic dysfunction with elevated
filling pressures, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and
mild pulmonary hypertension.  Her losartan was increased to 100
mg daily.  Her carvediolol was increased to 25 mg po bid.  She
was continued on her home dose of lasix at 20 mg daily as she
did not appear to volume overloaded.

# Hypertension: The patient's SBPs were found to be elvated so
her carvedilol was increased to 25 mg po bid and her losartan
was increased to 100 mg daily.  She was continued on lasix 20 mg
daily.  Prior to discharge her SBP ranged from 130's to 150's.

# Anemia:  The patient has known iron deficiency anemia; she had
recieved one unit of pRBC at OSH.  Her Hct ranged from 24.3 to
28.8 and she did not receive further tansfusion here as she was
not having active ischemia.  Her Hct on discharge was 28.2.

# Pneumonia/Pulmonary:  The patient had a leukocytosis on
admission of 13.0.  She had blood cultures and urine cultures
which were negative.  Her CXR showed a possible LLL infiltrate.
A sputum culture from [**11-24**] showed enterobacter cloacae and
klebsiella oxytoca which was sensitive to ceftriaxone.  While
the culture and sensitivities were pending she was treated with
zosyn (she had been started on this at the OSH on [**11-21**]) until
[**11-28**] when she was switched to ceftriaxone to complete a 10 day
course of antibiotic therapy for a pneumonia.

The patient suffered a cardiac arrest and was initally intubated
on transfer.  She was extubated after 9 days on the ventilator
and one failed extubation attempt earlier in the hospital stay.
It was thought that her inital failure to tolerate extubation
was due to a combination of the pneumonia, her mental status,
and her copious secretions.  She was given a scopolamine patch
to decrease her secretions and as her pneumonia was treated and
her mental status improved she was able to tolerate extubation.

# Diabetes:  The patient is on januvia and metformin as an
outpatient.  During her hospitalization these medications were
held.  She had qid finger sticks for monitoring of her blood
glucose and was covered with sliding scale insulin.  By the end
of her stay she was eating more and her sugars were higher so
she was restarted on her januvia and metformin at discharge.
