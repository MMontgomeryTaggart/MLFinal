Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 247**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, shortness of breath, cough.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
HPI:  85 y/o lady with chronic CHF, atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, h/o thromboembolic CVA in [**2596**], presents with
worsening dyspnea, fever, and cough.  Patient has experienced
chronic cough for ? weeks worse in the last week.  Non
productive.  She has felt warm and occasionally cold during this
time period.  She has had substernal chest discomfort with
coughing.  She felt genaralized weakness and decided to go to
[**Hospital 974**] Hospital.  ? Headache per previous records.  She had
decreased appetite and did not eat much yesterday.  She denies
any abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, dysuria,
hematuria, blood in stool, orthopnea, PND, focal weakness or
numbness.  Recent fall 2 weeks ago without traumatic injuries.
She feels generally week.
.
She presented to [**Hospital 974**] hospital.  Her BNP was elevated there
and with complaints of dyspnea she was thought to have CHF
exacerbation and given furosemide 40 mg IV.  Her heart rate was
rapid at 120s afib there and she was started on dilt drip.  She
also had fever to 101, WBC 14 and bands 18% and was started on
Zosyn.  Given her headache CT head was attempted but due to
technical difficulties they weren't able to get it.  She was
transfered to [**Hospital1 22**] ED to obtain a head CT.
.
On arrival to ED here vitals were T 98 SBP 90-100s.  Heart rates
were in 70-80s and dilt was discontinued.  Respiratory rates
were 19-20s.  Oxygen saturation was in low 80s in room air, low
90s on 6L NC and 99 on 100% NRB.  She did not have any headache.
 Exam was significant for bilateral crackles, trace guaiac
positive brown stool.
.
CXR was concerning for multifocal pneumonia and was given
cetriaxone 1 gm and levofloxacin 750 mg on top of the Zosyn from
OSH. Given the new findings, she was given 1L of NS and 2 gram
of calcium gluconate (to reverse dilt). Head CT did not show any
acute intracranial pathology.  Her potassium was repleted.

.
Blood culture ([**10-28**]): negative
Urine legionalla: negative
Rapid respiratory viral screen: negative
.
[**2609-10-28**] CXR:  Moderate cardiomegaly with a mildly unfolded
atherosclerotic thoracic aorta are unchanged. There are
multifocal areas of airspace opacities predominantly involving
the mid and lower lungs bilaterally, compatible with multifocal
pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures are grossly
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia.
.
[**2609-10-29**] CXR:  The heart is markedly enlarged. Aorta is somewhat
calcified and tortuous.  The lungs are hyperinflated consistent
with COPD. There are patchy perihilar opacities as well as mild
bibasilar atelectasis. The appearance of the chest has not
changed much since the prior study.
.
[**2609-10-28**] CT head:  1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  2. Left
sphenoid sinus air-fluid level may represent sinusitis in the
appropriate clinical context.
.
[**2609-10-30**] Video swallow study:  Multiple oral and pharyngeal
phase defects with associated penetration and aspiration,
partially reduced with chin tuck position. Please see the speech
and swallow note in the online medical record for further
details.

Brief Hospital Course:
An 85 year-old lady with chronic diastolic CHF, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, h/o thromboembolic CVA in [**2596**], now
presenting with worsening dyspnea, fever, and cough. She is
admitted to the ICU for oxygen requirement and hypotension.
.
FEVER/DYSPNEA
She presented with worsening cough, fever, leukocytosis, diffuse
crackles, and CXR consistent with multifocal pneumonia versus
aspiration pneumonitis.  Her BP dropped after presenting to the
ICU to 70s requiring IVF boluses, concerning for sepsis.  She
was bolused with normal saline and started on levofloxacin and
vancomycin for empiric broad spectrum coverage, given that she
had already received doses of Zosyn at OSH and ceftriaxone in
the ED.  Blood and sputum samples were sent for culture.
   Overnight there was significant clinical improvement.  She
was afebrile and had decreasing oxygen requirements to 4L to
maintain O2 sats in mid 90s.  Her blood pressure was stable and
white count was normal. She was transferred to the floors on
hospital day 1.  Her antibiotic regimen was narrowed to
levofloxacin for empiric treatment of CAP.  She remained stable
on this regimen, with no white count, no fevers, and a steady
improvement in symptoms.  At time of discharge, she will take
two more days of levofloxacin to complete a 7-day course.  She
is off of oxygen, with ambulatory O2 sats of 94-95%.  She is no
longer dyspneic.
   We believe that she may have had an aspiration event, causing
a pneumonitis.  This would account for her rather rapid
improvement in symptoms.  The other possibility, given CXR
findings of multifocal infiltrate, is that she has had an
atypical pneumonia, either bacterial or viral, in which case a
7-day course of levofloxacin should provide sufficient
antimicrobial coverage.  There was no positive culture data from
urine, blood, or sputum.
.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
This was evident on her chest x-rays and consistent with her
significant smoking history.  She had wheezes on exam and we
treated with standing and prn albuterol/ipratropium nebs.  She
is discharged with Combivent inhaler.
.
ANEMIA
Her hematocrit trended from 36.9 to 39 to 31.3, to 29.9.  We
believe this was a dilutional effect in the setting of
aggressive fluid rescusitation as all cell lines were
decreasing.  After hospital day 1, her hematocrit was stable in
the high twenties.
.
CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE
She had a TTE in [**2607-10-30**] that showed moderately
decreased left ventricular function with 3+ MR and 4+ TR.  On
exam during this admission she appeared euvolemic, with no lower
extremity pitting edema and mild crackles at the bases which
were hard to interpret in the setting of multifocal pneumonia
and diffuse scattered crackles.  We held her Lasix due to her
hypotension and concern that she was volume depleted.  With her
Lasix held, her creatinine returned to 0.8 from 1.3 at
admission.  Her BUN similarly decreased to 19 from 34 at
admission.  We have recommended that she stop the Lasix until
following up with her primary care physician.
.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
She was monitored on telemetry and continued on outpatient
digoxin.  Her rate was well-controlled.  We continued her
outpatient coumadin at 1 mg daily.  Her INR rose to 3.8 after
she was started on levofloxacin.  We held her coumadin for two
nights.  At time of discharge her INR is therapeutic and we have
resumed the coumadin, at alternating doses of 1 mg every other
day and 0.5 mg every other day.  She will have blood draws two
days after discharge and five days after discharge to recheck
coumadin levels.
.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
This resolved with intravenous fluids.
.
HISTORY OF CVA
CT head without contrast was normal.  There were no focal
neurologic deficits, apart from her difficulty swallowing (see
below), which may be unrelated to her history of cerebrovascular
accident.
.
DYSPHAGIA
Because she came in after a likely aspiration event, she was
evaluated by the speech and swallow pathologists.  After video
swallow study showed significant aspiration risk, they
recommended a po diet of soft solids and honey thick liquids
with meds crushed in puree.  She should sit upright when eating
and alternate sips with bites.  The S&S specialists also
recommended for home speech and swallow evaluation, which we
have arranged.
.
HYPOTHYROID
We continued her outpatient levothyroxine.
.
She was kept on a heart-healthy diet with prethickened liquids
and soft solids.  She was anticoagulated on warfarin throughout.
 Her code status is full code.

Discharge Condition:
Vital signs stable.  Afebrile.  Satting mid 90s on room air.


Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized for treatment of pneumonia.  A chest x-ray
confirmed this diagnosis.  We treated you with an antibiotic
called levofloxacin, which you should continue to take for a
full 7-day course.  Please continue to take levofloxacin at a
dose of 750 mg once every other day.  You will have two more
doses to take after you leave the hospital.
.
We found that the levels of coumadin in your blood were slightly
elevated during the last few days.  We will have visiting nurses
come to your house to measure the INR and will have the results
faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5949**] so that he can make adjustments to your
coumadin dose.  For the time being, please take 1 mg each night
on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday.  Please take 0.5 mg
each night on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
.
We stopped the Lasix (furosemide) because we thought that you
were dehydrated, and Lasix could cause this to worsen.  Please
do not take the Lasix until you see your primary care provider
next week.
.
You can use the Advair inhaler two to three times as needed for
shortness of breath.
.
Please follow-up with your primary care provider in one week.
We have scheduled an appointment that is listed below.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Monday, [**11-13**] at
2:15PM (the appointment has already been arranged). If you would
like to reschedule his office phone number is ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 15668**].
