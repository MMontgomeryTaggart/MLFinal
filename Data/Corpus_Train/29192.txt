History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 46 year-old man with a history of morbid
obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and depression who presented
to an outside hospital yesterday with massive hematemesis.  He
was in his usual state of health until yesterday morning when he
suddenly began coughing up large volumes of liquid bright red
blood and one large, solid clot of blood.  This persisted for
approximately 45 minutes before resolving spotaneously while he
was in the ambulance in transit to [**Hospital 229**] Hospital.  At the
outside hospital, his hematocrit was reportedly 38.7 and an NG
lavage was positive.  His hemoptysis then recurred (approx [**1-24**]
hours after initial event) and he was transferred here for
emergent bronchoscopy.  He was intubated in the ED in
preparation for bronchoscopy.  On presentation here, his
hematocrit was noted to be 34.8 and a CXR showed clear lungs.

Brief Hospital Course:
He underwent an emergent rigid bronchoscopy upon admission to
the ED which showed a large amount of fresh blood.  He was found
to have a LLL medial wall arterial "[**Last Name (un) 15991**]" gushing fresh blood,
which was cauterized.  He also had a large cast of
clot/tissue/tumor in the LLL which was removed and sent for
pathology.  He was sent to the SICU post-procedure where he
remained hemodynamically stable and was extubated without
difficulty.  He was sent to the medicine floor team at this
point where he remained hemodynamically stable with no evidence
of recurrent bleeding.  Because of his morbid obesity, he could
not undergo any further imaging (CT, MRI, etc) to evaluate for
potential causes of his massive hemoptysis.  The tissue sent
from his bronchoscopy returned as clot only, and cytology on the
bronchial brushings was negative.  He was arranged to have
follow up with interventional pulmonology for a repeat
bronchscopy in [**4-28**] weeks.

For his sleep apnea, he was continued on nightly BiPAP per his
home regimen.  His sister brought in his BiPAP machine fromhome
(since he didn't tolerate the hospital's machine) and it
accidentally fell and broke while in-house.  He was set up to
have a new machine delivered to his home immediately after
discharge.

Due to this bleeding and lack of documented CAD, his aspirin was
held while in-house and he was advised to continue holding it,
unless directed otherwise by his PCP.

For his depression, he was started on Effexor 225mg daily (he
had previously been on this dose before running out and never
refilled his prescriptions).  A social work consult saw the
patient and referred him to the Disabled Persons Protection
Commission and gave him the phone number for [**Hospital3 15992**]
Commission homemaker services for assistance due to his morbid
obesity.

He was set up with PCP follow up for the day after discharge
since he hadn't seen his PCP in over [**Name Initial (PRE) **] year.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after coughing up large
amounts of blood.  You emergently underwent a bronchoscopy which
showed an artery pumping blood into one of your major airways.
This blood vessel was cauterized and the bleeding stopped.  You
had a breathing tube placed down your throat to protect your
airway during this event.  You were taken off the breathing tube
without difficulty and remained stable when transferred to the
floor.  We do not yet have an explanation for why you had this
large episode of bleeding, so you need to follow up with our
pulmonologists (as scheduled below) for a repeat bronchoscopy.

Please attend all follow-up appointments as scheduled.  Please
take all medications as prescribed.

If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, high fevers,
loss of consciousness, coughing up of blood, or any other
concerning symptoms, you need to seek medical attention.

Followup Instructions:
Primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 21**]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1027**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Hospital 229**] Hospital):
Friday [**2783-12-2**] at 11:15 am; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5192**]

Pulmonology for repeat bronchoscopy (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: [**2784-1-2**];
arrive at 7:30 am to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 8 Day Care Unit; you cannot have any
food or drink (except for medications) after midnight the
evening before the procedure.  You should not take aspirin for
the five days prior to the procedure because it thins the blood.
