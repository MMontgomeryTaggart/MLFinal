Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 764**]
Chief Complaint:
Capsular hematoma and pneumothorax post liver biopsy.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
percutaneous liver biopsy


History of Present Illness:
68 year-old male with recently diagnosed HTN and liver mass
admitted for hemodynamic monitoring from intraperitoneal bleed
after liver biopsy. Mass was incidentally discovered on a CT for
nephrolithiasis [**3043**], and initially believed to be in
pancreas. CT and MR of the abdomen showed 4x3cm mass to be in
caudate liver. He presented for IR liver biopsy on [**4-18**], which
was complicated by small RUL ptx. He was under observation when
HCT dropped from 53 (admit) to 41 this morning. Of note, HCT was
45 post bx-->41 14 hrs later. CT abd/pelvis showed subcapsular
hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed, blood in pelvis. On transfer to
MICU for close observation hemodynamically stable and normal.
Denies SOB, dizziness, abd pain. Had stopped baby ASA one week
prior to liver bx.

Past Medical History:
1. Liver mass as above
2. AAA 3x3 with minimal prior dissection
3. Nephrolithiasis (fall [**3109**])
4. Hypertension (diagnosed two weeks prior, no medications)
5. Right inguinal hernia status post repair [**5-/3110**]
6. Arthritis
7. Alcohol abuse

Social History:
Retired school teacher, lives in [**Hospital1 2147**] currently with dying
brother. [**Name (NI) 447**] reports smoking [**5-25**] cigs/day for 40 years and 2
drinks/week. However, cousin told nurse that patient drinks and
smokes much more than he admits. No prior blood transfusions.

Family History:
Brother has prostate Ca, colon cancer, CAD s/p bypass, now dying
from cancer metastases. No family hx of pancreatic/liver
disease.

CT LIVER BX  [**3111-4-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Technically successful CT fluoroscopic-guided biopsy of
periportal/caudate lobe lesion.
2. Small right (10-15%) pneumothorax.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3111-4-18**] 3:19 PM
CHEST, TWO VIEWS, PA AND LATERAL
History of liver biopsy with pneumothorax on post-scan
radiograph.
The previous chest radiographs are not on PACS for review. There
is a small right pneumothorax.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3111-4-18**] 5:02 PM
CONCLUSION: Stable right apical pneumothorax as compared to
earlier today at 3:30 p.m.
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**3111-4-18**]
FINDINGS: This study was performed in conjunction with the CT
fluoroscopic-guided biopsy done on same day ([**3111-4-18**]). Study
was performed to assess feasibility to see if the lesion could
be biopsied by ultrasound or CT fluoroscopy.
Again seen is a periportal echogenic vascular lesion measuring
approximately 2.2 cm in size. However, based on its location, it
was decided that the best approach for sampling this lesion
would be performed by CT fluoroscopy.
.
ECG Study Date of [**3111-4-18**]  4:16:14 PM
Sinus rhythm. Biatrial enlargement. Non-specific inferolateral
ST-T wave
flattening. Delayed precordial R wave progression. No previous
tracing
available for comparison.
.
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**3111-4-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged right hepatic hematoma. No active extravasation.
Increased prominence of the segment VII and VIII hepatic artery
branch could reflect that this was the prior source of bleeding,
though this is uncertain.
2. Heterogeneous perfusion of the liver likely related to _____
hematoma and the fact that the patient had heterogeneous
perfusion prior to the procedure. No narrowing or thrombosis of
hepatic or portal veins.
3. Large lesser sac hematoma and hemoperitoneum, as before.
4. Unchanged appearance of mass adjacent to the caudate lobe.
5. Decreased size of right pneumothorax with small remaining
pneumothorax.
6. High-grade right renal artery stenosis.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3111-4-19**]
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of pneumothorax after liver
biopsy.
PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to [**3111-4-18**].
The small right apical pneumothorax is stable or slightly
decreased compared to the previous study giving the expiratory
technique of the current exam. The marked emphysema and
subpleural bullae are unchanged in appearance. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3111-4-20**]
CHEST TWO VIEWS PA AND LATERAL
History of liver biopsy and pneumothorax.
There is a persistent small right apical pneumothorax
essentially unchanged since the previous film of [**3111-4-19**],
there are new lung lesions.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old male with incidentally discovered liver mass who
presented to CT guided liver biopsy, compicated by right apical
pneumothorax and peri-hepatic/intrapelvic hematoma, transferred
to the ICU for closer monitoring.

1) Liver mass:  As above, the patient underwent CT guided biopsy
on arrival.  The pathology is still pending at the time of
discharge.  Complicated by pneumothorax and bleeding (see
below).  The patient will follow up with his home GI doctor, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 17206**], who should call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1529**] for results of the liver
biopsy.

2) Peri-hepatic hematoma/intra-pelvic bleed:  Secondary to liver
biopsy.  His hematocrit on arrival was 53, declining to 45
post-procedure, and then slowly trending down by a couple of
points an hour to a nadir of 31.5.  He did not require any red
blood cell transfusions, and his hematocrit stabilized at around
32; 32.5 on the day of discharge.  His aspirin had been
discontinued 7 days prior to admission, and should not be
restarted for at least a week, possibly longer, pending repeat
hematocrit check by his PCP.

3) Pneumothorax:  He developed a small right apical pneumothorax
secondary to the procedure.  His oxygenation was never impaired
(>95% on room air throughout).  He was given high flow O2 to
speed the resolution.  Followup chest x-rays demonstrated
improvement/resolution of the pneumothorax.

4) Alcohol abuse:  Though he denied significant alcohol use, his
platelet count was on the low side, with elevated MCV, and his
family reported significant use.  He was therefore placed on a
CIWA scale and required only one 10 mg dose of valium.  He was
not tachycardic, and appeared comfortable on discharge.  He had
a social work consult who spoke to him about both his alcohol
use and smoking.  He would like to try the patch and he was
given a prescription for this.  He is somewhat in denial about
having a problem with drinking.

5) Hypertension:  He was normotensive during the admission.
This will be followed by his PCP.

Medications on Admission:
ASA 81 mg daily
MVI

Discharge Medications:
1. Multi-Vitamin     Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
2. Nicotine 14 mg/24 hr Patch 24 hr Sig: One (1) patch
Transdermal once a day.
Disp:*30 patches* Refills:*2*


Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Intrabdominal bleed (subcapsular hematoma of liver, pelvis)
Right upper lobe pneumothorax secondary to liver biopsy
complications.
Hepatic mass
Alcohol withdrawal


Discharge Condition:
stable, no signs/symptoms of further bleeding


Discharge Instructions:
You had a liver biopsy which resulted in minor collapse of your
R lung which is resolving, and some internal bleeding.  You were
monitored with serial checks of blood levels which were fine.

Please seek medical attention immediately if you experience any
symptoms of further bleeding such as shortness of breath,
dizziness or chest pain.

Because of your bleeding, you should not take your baby Aspirin
for at least the next week, and probably not until you see your
primary care doctor, who should recheck your blood level.

Followup Instructions:
Follow up with PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17652**] in [**12-20**] weeks.

Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17206**] in the next 1-2 weeks.  He should call Dr. [**Name (NI) 17653**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1682**] to get the report from your
liver biopsy.
