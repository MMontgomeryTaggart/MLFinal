Indication: Intra-op TEE for off Pump CABG
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**3224-5-10**] at 09:33
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2007AW02-:

Technical Quality: Adequate




REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 55% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
anterior apex -
hypo; septal apex - hypo; apex - hypo; remaining LV segments
contract
normally.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: No MS. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The remaining left
ventricular
segments contract normally.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is
seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post OPCAB: Pt is receiving an infusion of pheylephrine.
1. Biventricular function is preserved.
2. Other findings are unchanged
