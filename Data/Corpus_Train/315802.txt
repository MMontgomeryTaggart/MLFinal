   A/P: 39 year old male with Type I Diabetes, Hep C, h/o polysubstance
   abuse who presented with DKA and chest pain after not taking his
   insulin for 2 days
   .
   # DKA: Likely secondary to not taking his insulin for 2 days. no
   evidenc of infection on exam. CXR negative, UA negative.
   - Continue vigrous hydration with NS at 1 liter per hour
   - Continue insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] prtocol
   - Monitor pH, HCO3 and Potassium
   # Hyperkalemia
   .
   # Chest pressure: Pain lasted approxiamtely 1 hour. Now resolved. Had
   peaked T waves, but no other ECG changes and first set CE's negative.
   - ROMI with CE's x 3
   # Polysubstance abuse: currently denies use. Can offer addictions
   counseling information
   .
   # CAD: Continue ASA. He is not on a BB given his cocaine use.
