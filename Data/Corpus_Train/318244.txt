   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F w/ hodgkin's s/p autosct, ITP, now with altered mental status,
   syncopal episode and transient hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: the patient is an extremely high aspiration
   risk given ?vocal cord paralysis and recent dysphagia. Was in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   1 week ago for a similar hypoxic episode, thought to be secondary to
   aspiration at that time. The patient has since developed bibasilar
   infiltrates on CXR and on exam, had no breath sounds at the left base.
   She has been on very broad spectrum antibiotics for this.
   Currently, the differential diagnosis of the hypoxia witnessed during
   today's syncopal event includes a new aspiration pneumonitis (likely
   given hx and secretions) in the setting of an already brewing pna in
   the LLL, PE (possible since only on boots s/p brain surgery, however no
   other changes and has radiographic findings that support infectious
   etiology), acute coronary syndrome (but EKG unchanged and negative set
   of cardiac enzymes).
   - will treat for asp pneumonitis with supportive care, suctioning, O2
   etc. Satting very well on minimal supplemental O2 right now.
   - continue flagyl and vanco for now to also cover potential
   intracranial infection, would prefer cefepime instead of aztreonam for
   postoperative neurosurgical infection, but patient is pen allergic.
   - repeat sputum cx and assess interval change on CXR
   - although PE is quite possible, there continues to be no evidence of
   RH strain on EKG, and there is no appreciable difference in her
   tachycardia as this has been ongoing.  Will treat other etiologies and
   consider CTA in am if remains hypoxic.
   - continue nebs as per previous
   .
   # Hypotension: patient was transiently hypotensive to the 80's during
   this syncopal episode, she has not been taking good PO's in last 24
   hours or so, secondary to nausea. Her pressure rebounded quickly with
   minimal fluids and has remained stable. Could be infection, but patient
   is afebrile and is otherwise not appearing bacteremic.
   - continue to monitor.
   - small boluses as required given history of systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, albeit mild.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: the patient was thought to have CNS lymphoma
   vs. paraneoplastic syndrome vs. PML explaining her difficulty with
   vocal cord paralysis, and proximal weakness, although the biopsy is
   still pending, the findings so far are inconsistent with lymphoma or
   PML. Currently, in the setting of today's syncopal episode, a stat head
   CT showed new edema surrounding the site of biopsy. This is concerning
   for infection. Neurosurgery is on board.  Cultures, EBV PCR, and [**Male First Name (un) 549**]
   Virus PCR from CSF were all negative. HSV PCR was negative.
   - MRI with gad to further evaluate edema
   - continue antibiotics but ?coverage for intraparenchymal brain abscess
   that covers anaerobes
   - holding on steroids per neurosurg for now
   - q2h neuro checks
   - f/u brain bx results
   - f/u pending studies
   .
   # Tachycardia: baseline HR appears to be 100-110 for last several
   days.  Sinus tachy on EKG.  [**Month (only) 47**] be in setting of hypoxia and anxiety.
   Also consider PE as above.  Tachycardia may also be worsening her
   diastolic dysfunction leading to increased pulm congestion.
   - continue metop [**Hospital1 **] as scheduled.
   .
   # Cards Pump: Echo showed decreased EF with systolic dysfunction and
   diastolic dysfunction. No evidence of volume overload on exam, on
   contrary, likely there is some hypovolemia given syncope and transient
   hypotension.
   - rate control with metoprolol
   .
   # Cards vascular: no known hx CAD.  Monitor on telemetry.
   - BB
   - hold on ASA for now.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: had been receiving IV Vitamin K and now INR has
   normalized.  Coagulopathy thought [**1-6**] liver involvement of cancer
   - trend daily
   .
   # Recent seizure/neuro: continue keppra 1500 [**Hospital1 **].  no evidence of
   seizure activity on exam.
   .
   # Lymphoma: defer to heme/onc for further management, ?chemo
   - continue antifungal
   .
   # anemia: has been in mid-20s. Goal HCT is >21.
   - note: needs irradiated blood [**1-6**] to SCT
   .
   # h/o ITP: s/p splenectomy and rituxan. on outpt. prednisone taper but
   this has been stopped
