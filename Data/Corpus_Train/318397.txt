   Assessment and Plan
   1. fever - resolved
   2. leukocytosis - resolved
   3. GPC bacteremia -
   4. foreign object in bladder
   5. chest pain this am
   79M with cad, pvd, foreign body in the bladder, presents with high
   fevers and leukocytosis, with GPC bacteremia. No other source of
   infection. Patient improved with IV hydration and antibiotics (CTX and
   vancomycin). Also acute renal failure is resolving. Chest pain today
   reproducible on exam, unlikley cardiac, although very high risk of
   recurrent ischemia:
   -continue vancomycin and ctx for presumed uti and gcp bacteremia
   -follow-up cultures, speciation
   -follow enzymes to rule out for MI; will obtain another EKG if any new
   sx; cxr unchanged
   -call out to the floor today
