Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, AS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS
Patient is a 52 M w/ pmh of SVT and MVP who presents s/p syncope
after exertion.
Syncope: OSH w/ ECHO showing severe AS w/ valve area of 0.9.  He
also was found to have LVH so this could also be consistent w/
outflow-tract obstruction from HOCM.  Also could have been [**2-27**]
VT.  Currently hemodynamically stable without further symptoms.
If found to have HOCM, could be a candidate for alcohol septal
ablation vs surgical myomectomy.  Would also potentially need an
ICD.  If found to have critical AS as the cause, would likely
need AVR.
- tele
- ECHO
- low-dose metoprolol to inc filling time
CAD: no history. Had trop leak in the setting of [**Month/Day (2) 22731**] so would
not consider this ACS.
- fasting lipids
Taken to the OR on [**10-20**], underwent AVR (tissue), please see
operative report for details of surgical procedure.  He was
weaned from mechanical ventilation, and extubated the day of
surgery.  His chest tubes were removed on POD # 1, and he was
transferred from the ICU to the telemetry unit.  He has remained
hemodynamically stable, and is ready to be discharged home.  Due
to relatively low BP (asymptomatic), he is being discharged with
no beta blockers per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
