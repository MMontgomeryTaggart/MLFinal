   NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
   shift
   of normally midline structures, mass, mass effect, or edema. There is
   dilation of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles noted. The
   osseous
   structures are grossly unremarkable. Scattered opacification of the
   maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses is noted.
   IMPRESSION: Limited exam without evidence of acute intracranial
   process.
   CTA chest: [**2981-5-28**]
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus to the lobar level.
   2. An endotracheal tube lies 1 cm above the carina.
   3. Bilateral patchy consolidative changes may represent atelectasis,
   edema or
   aspiration pneumonia as secretions are noted in the airways.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 885**] is a 49 yo M with dwarfism, chronic LE lymphedema with
   recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis c/b tachycardia,
   dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Altered Mental Status - unclear
   inciting cause for acute hypercarbia in the ED which prompted
   intubation, Other considerations include pulmonary edema vs.
   pneumonia.  Concern re: CHF   An intracranial event such as CVA or
   hemorrhage although not seen on CT scan.
   -continue with mechanical ventillation
   -check ABG
   -consider SBT later today
   -bolus sedation with versed
   -check ECHO for evidence of CHF.  Consider lasix if evidence of CHF.
   Obtain record of previous ECHO from [**Hospital1 595**].
   .
   #dyspnea, sinus tachycardia- unclear etiology, main concern at OSH was
   for pulmonary embolus, however not seen on preliminary report of CTA,
   other possibilities include pulmonary edema
   .
   #Bilateral LE cellulitis - unclear if new cellulitis or just chronic
   stasis in setting of lymphedema.  No WBC or fever at OSH, unclear if
   appearance has changed since IV abx.
   -continue vancomycin for now
   -elevated LE
   -examen back later today.
   .
   #Hypertension - currently normotensive
   -hold outpatient regimen of metoprolol and terazosin
   .
   #Stage II Sacral Decubitus - noted at osh
   -wound care
   -consdier wound consult for reccs
   .
   #FEN - replete lytes prn, volume status unclear, NPO continue with OGT
   to suction
   .
   #PPX: heparin sq, PPI, bowel reg prn, HOB at 30 deg, mouth care
