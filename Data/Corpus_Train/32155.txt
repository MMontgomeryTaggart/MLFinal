Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 173**]
Chief Complaint:
mitral valve regurgitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3452-12-17**] Mitral valve repair (28mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 262**] annuloplasty ring)
[**3452-12-24**] Right Hip Hemi-arthroplasty


History of Present Illness:
This 73 year old  female has severe mitral regurgitation,
moderate TR and single vessel coronary artery disease who was
admitted now for elective surgery. She has been followed
preoperativley and underwent diuresis and some pulmonary
rehabilitation.  Since a previous visit in [**3452-5-30**], she has
gained approximately [**11-13**] pounds with increased appetite and
nutritional supplements. When first seen by our service she
weighed only 83 pounds. Overall she remains mildly fatigued and
continues to experience exertional dyspnea. It is difficult to
get her to admit to much in the way of symptoms however her son
is helpful in helping her to acknowledge the significance of her
symptoms. Overall, her symptoms have remained stable and have
not significantly worsened with her current medical therapy. She
is high risk due to her heavy smoking history and poor lung
function.

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**3452-12-17**]: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale with
bidirectional flow is present. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is
partial posterior mitral leaflet flail (P2 closer to P1). Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No tricuspid prolapse or
flail segments. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results before surgical incision.
Post_Bypass: Normal RV systolic function. Patient is on
epinephrine infusion. LVEF 50%. Intact thoracic aorta. Mitral
valve post repair is intact, stable, no mitral regurgitation and
no mitral stenosis. TR looks mild and at worst possibly 2+.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 15333**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 22**] on [**3452-12-16**] for surgical
management of her mitral valve disease. She was admitted one day
prior to surgery for Heparin administration (chronic AF) and
underwent usual pre-operative work-up. She was taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent mitral valve repair. Please
see operative note for details. Post-operatively she was taken
to the intensive care unit for monitoring for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Over the next 24 hours, she was
weaned from sedation and pressors, awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated.

Beta-blockers and diuretics were started and she was gently
diuresed towards her pre-op weight. On post-op day two she was
transferred to the step-down floor for further recovery.
Coumadin was restarted for chronic atrial fibrillation.  The
patient reported pain with ambulation while working with
Physical Therapy.  She then admitted that she sustained a fall
pre-operatively, which was not reported and hence not worked up.
 Hip X-ray revealed femoral neck fracture.  Orthopedic surgery
was consulted.  The INR was reversed with FFP and she was taken
to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3111**] for right hip
hemiarthroplasty on [**3452-12-24**].  Overall she tolerated this
procedure well and returned to [**Location 17174**] for post-op recovery.  She
did have low urine output which responded to Lasix.  Her
creatinine remained within normal limits.  Urinalysis was
positive, and she was started empirically on Cipro, pending
culture. The culture was, however, negative and antibiotics were
discontinued. Coumadin was resumed for chronic atrial
fibrillation.  She was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.

The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  She is to be weight
bearing as tolerated and on anterior hip precautions per
orthopedics.  She will follow up in the Orthopedic Clinic for
staple removal 2 weeks post-op.

 By the time of discharge on POD [**12-27**] the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 14160**] in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
Her Coumadin will be managed at this time by the rehab center,
with an INR goal of [**3-3**].5.
