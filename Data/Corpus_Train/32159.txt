CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval effusion, ? pneumothorax- please do this study at
11 am

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old woman s/p removal of left sided chest tube today
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval effusion, ? pneumothorax- please do this study at 11 am
INDICATION: 74-year-old female status post removal of left-sided
chest tube.

COMPARISON: [**2521-3-6**].

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A tracheostomy tube is in unchanged
position. There has been interval removal of the left-sided
chest tube. There is no recurrent or residual pneumothorax. The
remainder of the examination is little changed with no
significant improvement in the degree of moderate pulmonary
edema, bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pneumothorax.
2. Moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
effusions.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: re-evaluate left pleural effusion

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
re-evaluate left pleural effusion
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 74-year-old female for re-evaluation of left pleural
effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2525-2-14**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial imaging of the chest without
intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were
obtained and reviewed.

FINDINGS: Left PICC remains in place, tip in the upper right
atrium. Evidence of prior coronary artery bypass grafting is
unchanged, with sternotomy wires, unchanged sternal dehiscence,
and densely calcified native coronary arteries. Moderate
cardiomegaly is unchanged. Multiple prominent mediastinal and
hilar lymph nodes are unchanged. Tracheostomy tube remains in
place, approximately 5 cm above the carina. Left chest tube
remains in place, with tip positioned medially near the apex.
New drainage catheter is in place at the left lung base, and the
small left pleural effusion is slightly decreased in size, with
small foci of gas now seen within the effusion . Small right
pleural effusion is little changed.

Diffuse ground-glass opacity throughout both lungs, along with
small centrilobular nodules, and mild apical predominant
interlobular septal thickening is again noted, slightly improved
since prior exam.

Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly decreased size of small left pleural effusion, with
new left basilar chest tube in place, and second old left chest
tube unchanged in position medially near the left apex.
2. Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
3. Slightly improved appearance of diffuse ground-glass opacity,
small centrilobular nodules, and apical predominant interlobular
septal thickening. This could represent improvement in pulmonary
edema, infectious process, or both.

valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS.
Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Thickened/fibrotic tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS.
Mild [1+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical views. Suboptimal image quality -
poor subcostal views. Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Conclusions
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. LV systolic
function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection
fraction 30 percent). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2525-1-15**], findings are grossly similar although the
suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive
comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient well know to our service, was transferred to
rehabilitation on [**2-1**]. transferred from rehabilitation center
to [**Hospital6 11441**] because of hypotension associated
with atrial fibrillation, started on Neosynephrine gtt. Patient
then transferred from [**Hospital6 11441**] to [**Hospital1 22**] for
further management. Atrial fibrillation converted to sinus
rhythm after treatment with IV Amiodarone, Neosynephrine
infusion then weaned to off. Patient arrived on full ventilatory
support and was changed to pressure support ventilation and
weaned from there. She had a chest CT which revealed a left
effusion Thoracic surgery was consulted and a chest tube was
placed, the pleural fluid was positive for VRE. A subsequent
pigtail catheter was placed to drain a small loculated effusion.
After the pigtail catheter was removed the pleural chest tube
was gradually pulled back by the thoracic surgery team. It was
then changed to an empyema tube. TPA was instilled x 3. The
patient was also followed by the infectious disease service. She
remains on fluconazole (8 weeks from [**1-12**]) for her previous
candidemia and candidal sternal wound infection, and daptomycin
(total 6 weeks from [**2-10**]) and ciprofloxacin (4 weeks from [**2-15**])
for VRE in pleural effusion and E coli and VRE in thigh wound.
Bronchoscopy showed tracheomalacia and she was seen by IP. BAL
grew psuedomonas.
On [**2-27**] she again underwent bronchoscopy, a Y stent was placed
for severe tracheobroncheomalacia, and her trach was changed.
She was started on mucinex, normal saline via trach tube and
mucomyst nebs for stent maintenance.
She continued to have low urine output, and her BUN and
creatinie rose. THis did not improve with multiple interventions
including milrinone, netrecor, lasix drip, and albumin. She was
seen by renal, and eventually started on CVVH.  She was
continued on CVVH until [**3-14**] and was going to be transitioned to
HD.  It was felt she would not tolerate HD and the family
discussed the options with the patient.  She had a living will
and after multiple meetings with all of the family members and
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] they decided to withdraw support.  On [**3-16**] the
ventilator was discontinued and the pt. expired at 3:16PM with
the family present.
