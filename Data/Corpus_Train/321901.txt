Chief Complaint:  Hypoxia, resp distress
   HPI:
   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo, difficult to control paroxysmal a.fib w/
   RVR, ileus, pericardial effusion requiring pericardial window and
   pleural effusions.  Pt recently started ICE on [**2897-8-2**]. This regimen
   can cause transient neurotoxicity. The patient was noted to have some
   altered mental status thought to be consistent with neurotoxicity. She
   also complained of nausea and had non-bloody emesis with breakfast. The
   patient's caretaker who was in the room with the patient all morning
   reports that the patient was coughing during breakfast prior to her
   episode of emesis. After vomiting her coughing stopped. The patient was
   found on routine vitals to have cold hands and oxygen saturation in the
   low 80's%, not improved with 3L NC. She improved to 92% on a NRB. EKG
   during the event revealed pseudonormalization
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, pt was in acute respiratory distress with sats
   in 70s.  Sats came up to low 90s on the NRB but pt continued to have
   increased work of breathing, not moving air well bilaterally.  Decision
   was made to intubate for resp distress. ETT was placed successfully, no
   issues with hypotension.  Nursing noted significant diarrhea post
   intubation.

   Imaging: CXR: from am [**2897-8-6**] stable bilateral pleural effusions and CXR
   obtained at 11:45am prior to intubation showed complete opacification
   of Right lung (confirmed upright film).  Now CXR s/p intubation shows
   improved aeration of Right lung with large bilateral effusions
   .
   CT Chest [**2897-7-30**]: IMPRESSION:
   1. Slight interval improvement in anterior mediastinal mass and
   bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy consistent with slight interval
   improvement of disease.
   2. Diffusely distended and featureless rectum to transverse colon with
   fluid and slight wall thickening consistent with colitis. Clinical
   correlation is advised.
   3. Improvement in left upper lobe centrilobular consolidation
   suggestive of interval improvement in infectious process.
   4. Unchanged right moderate pleural effusion with associated right
   lower lobe atelectasis.
   5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
   .
   ECHO [**2897-7-15**]: Conclusions
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There
   is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
   with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion located around right atrium and
   ventricle without evidence of tamponade.
   .
   ECG: EKG: NSR with rate in 70s, pseudonormalization of TWaves as
   compared to prior tracings, stable inferolateral q waves seen in
   I/II/III/AVF
   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2897-8-2**] presented with acute respiratory
   distress likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging now intubated.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration & mucus plugging in the setting of
   depressed mental status, coughing and emesis. A component of volume
   overload cannot be excluded given her I/O positive >7 liters over the
   past several days. A primary lung reaction to her chemo is much less
   likely. Other possibilities including a primary cardiac event or PE are
   less likely with a relatively unchanged EKG and no tachycardia.  Given
   rapid improvement of CXR after intubation, suspect that right lung
   white out was due to mucus plugging. ABG post intubation showed
   signficant acidosis with pH of 7.27.
   - increase RR & recheck ABG
   - advance ETT & recheck placement
   - no need for Abx currently
   - f/u sputum Cx & low threshold to start ABx if spikes temp
   - wean sedation, SBT & RSBI in am
   - continue regular suction & albuterol MDI
   - diuresis goal neg 1-2L
   - consider thoracentesis for diagnosis & therapeutic
   - recheck EKG (given pseudonormalization on tracing from am)
   - cycle CE to ROMI
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2897-5-14**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**12-6**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2897-4-17**] and
   pericardial window on [**2896-5-17**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on [**2897-8-2**].
   This acute hypoxia more likely due to aspiration & mucus plug, unlikely
   due to chemo toxicity.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - f/u Onc recs
   - transfuse to maintain hct>25
   .
   # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes, currently having alot of stool
   output with recent C. Diff toxin + [**2897-6-1**] & [**2897-6-25**].
   - will keep NPO for now (possible extubation in am)
   - continue po vanco & IV flagyl
   - place rectal tube now
   - OG tube to intermittent suction
   - f/u C diff toxin
   - repeat imaging in am
   .
   # Paroxysmal A-fib: Recent adm to ICU due to poor rate control (rates
   of 160 with relative hypotension). Rates have been better controlled on
   current regimen of Metoprolol, Amiodarone & Diltiazem.  No plan for
   anticoagulation due to bloody pericardial effusion.  Currently in NSR
   with rate in 60s.
   - continue Metoprolol & diltiazem & amiodarone
   - f/u repeat EKG
   .
   # UA: Pt had positive UA on [**8-4**], Urine Cx + fungus 4000-6000 CFUs.
   Received fluconazole 400mg x 1
   - change out foley now
   - resend UA & Urine Cx
   - hold off on Fluconazole for now
   .
   # F/E/N: IVF prn, NPO for now, OG tube to intermittent suction
   - replete lytes agressively
