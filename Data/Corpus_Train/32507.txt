Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up prior to admission. On [**2-25**] he was brought directly to
the operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft x 4. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Later that day he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Beta-blockers and diuretics were started and he was gently
diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Amiodarone was given due to
atrial ectopy with good effect. On post-op day two he was
transferred to the step-down unit for further care. Chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed pre protocol. During
his post-op course he worked with physical therapy for strength
and mobility. He continued to make good progress and on post-op
day four he was discharged home with the appropriate medications
and follow-up appointments.
