   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2897-8-2**] presented with tachycardia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   Respiratory distress
 O2 requirements improved from yesterday with
   diuresis. The possible etiologies for Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3015**] are mucus plug or
   atelectases in the setting of a negative PE-CT scan; patient improved
   rapidly for pneumonia and CXR is unchanged. Pateint may benefit from
   right  pleural effusion therapeutic thoracoscentesis to expand right
   lower lobe.
   - Discuss with IP risk & benefits of thoracoscentesis; pt not a
   candidate for chest tube since neutropenic. If pt. going for [**Female First Name (un) 1120**],
   then will need PLTs transfusion (ready).
   - cont nebs
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - chest PT
   .
    # Paroxysmal A-fib: Patient on and off atrial fibrillation/flutter.
   Sometimes rate controlled, sometimes with RVR. Patient with pericardial
   effusion and multiple pulmonary processes, which may be precipitating
   AF/Fl. Currently on amiodarone, diltiazem and metoprolol. Diltiazem
   drip was stopped in AM. If patient has another episode we will consider
   loading digoxin.
   - on telemetry
   - repeat EKG
   - continue BBlocker, titrate as blood pressure will tolerate
   - continue amiodarone at current dose
   - consider digoxin if in fib and persistently tachycardia
   .
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2897-5-14**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**12-6**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2897-4-17**] and
   pericardial window on [**2896-5-17**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2897-8-2**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy. Ideally should be
   transfused for hct>30 to maintain oxygenation.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - crit today is 24, HCT goal 25, plt goal 20
   - patient is now neutropenic with decreased platelets likely secondary
   to chemo nadir, on filgrastrim
   - continue vanc, cefepime and caspo for empiric neutropenic coverage
   # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes.  recent C. Diff toxin + [**2897-6-1**] &
   [**2897-6-25**].  C. diff [**8-12**] negative.
   - pt on definitive treatment for C. diff with IV flagyl and PO vanco
   - will continue for as long as patient on additional antibiotics
   .
   # F/E/N: NPO for now, will assess by S&S today.
   - NPO for now
   - replete lytes per onc sliding scales
   # PPX: PPI, no heparin for low platelets
   # CODE: Intubate/DNR
   # ACCESS: right arm PICC
   # CONTACT: HCP - brother [**Name (NI) 3018**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3019**] (mobile) and [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3020**]
   (home); brother also gave permission to speak with his wife [**Name (NI) 864**]
   #Dispo: ICU for now for thocacosentesis and BP/HR monitoring.
