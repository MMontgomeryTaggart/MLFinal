Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. PFO is present.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Eccentric MR jet. Severe (4+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:

N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen
at rest. A small secundum type ASD IS SEEN
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Echogenicity
noted in the descending aortic distal to the arch, consistent
with a intra-aortic balloon pump.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen with noted restricted posterior leaflet motion. Anterior
leaflet length in 2.0cm and the Posterior leaflet length in
1.0cm with a C-[**Month (only) **] distance of 2.4 cm.
8. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
9. There is a small pericardial effusion.
10. There is a large right sided pleural effusion.

POST-BYPASS:
1. Patient is on an epinephrine infusion along with small doses
of phenylephrine.
2. Normal RV systolic function.
3. Overall LVEF is 40%. There is some mild improvement of
lateral wall functions.
4. There is a mitral annulus ring seen and it is stable and
functioning well with no residual MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
5. Thoracic Aortic contour is intact.
6. Intact interatrial septum.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Reason: evaluate effusion

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old woman s/p CABG MV repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
STUDY: AP chest, [**2665-11-26**].

HISTORY: 69-year-old woman with CABG and mitral valve repair.

FINDINGS: Sternotomy wires and aortic valve prosthesis are again
seen. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within normal
limits. There is a left retrocardiac opacity and left-sided
pleural effusion. There is some atelectasis at the right lung
base. There is again seen a calcified lesion within the right
proximal humerus that likely represents _____ bone infarct or
calcified enchondroma as described on the prior study.
Comparison with more remote films would be helpful. Otherwise,
dedicated shoulder radiographs would be helpful.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to [**Hospital1 22**] on [**11-14**] from [**Doctor First Name 3093**] Hospital for coronary
bypass surgery, IABP placed at OSH. She was seen by ID and
Treated initially for klebsiella UTI then brought to OR on
[**11-17**], please see OR note for details. In summary the patient
had CABGx3(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM,SVG-RCA)MVRepair(#26 Physio ring)ASD
closure. Her bypass time was 161 minutes with a crossclamp time
of 126 min. She tolerated the operation well and was transferred
to the cardiac ICU in stable condition. The patient was kept
sedated and intubated on the day of surgery and on POD1 her IABP
was removed and she was extubated. The patient remained in the
ICU for several days to wean from her iv medications, her course
was also complicated by intermittant Atrial fibrillation for
which she was started on Amiodarone both IV and PO. On POD8 she
was transferred to the step down floor for further care. She was
started on erythromycin eye ointment for supposed
conjunctivitis. On the floor her po medications were further
adjusted, her activity level was advanced with PT and on POD#12
it was decided she was stable and ready for discharge to rehab.
