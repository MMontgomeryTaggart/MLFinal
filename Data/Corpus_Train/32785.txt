Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13425**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2737-11-6**] - Synchronized electrical cardioversion
[**2737-11-8**] - AVNRT ablation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 year old male with medical history that
includes non-ischemic cardiomyopathy thought to be secondary to
velcade/rituxan (now with normalized left ventricular function),
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, supraventricular
tachycardia,  severe tricuspid regurgitation, ESRD secondary to
waldenstroms macroglobulinemia, and metastatic prostate cancer
who is transferred from [**Hospital 974**] Hospital with hypotension and
supraventricular tachycardia.  For the past couple weeks he
reports worsening dyspnea. At baseline his functional status is
limited as he becomes dyspniec with ambulation of 10-20feet.
Lately, however he becomes short of breath just with
transitioning from sitting to standing or any ambulation. He
also endorses episodes of waking up at night feeling very short
of breath. He also endorses worsening lower extremity edema but
is not clear if his weight has changed. He denies chest pain,
fever, chills. He reports stable bone pain related to his
metastatic prostate cancer.  At dialysis this past week, he was
felt to be volume overloaded and underwent extra ultrafiltration
with removal of 6.5kg Tuesday, 2.5kg Wednesday, and 1kg Thursday
with some improvement in his breathing and lower extremity
edema. Per notes, he usually tolerates a blood pressure in the
80s during dialysis.
.
He is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 130**] for cardiomyopathy and was referred
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 528**] for evaluation of supraventricular
tachycardia. In [**4-/2737**], he underwent successful DCCV for atrial
fibrillation. During the procedure, he went into
supraventricular tachycardia that did not respond to vagal
maneuvers but broke with adenosine. Since that time he has been
noted during dialysis session to be in SVT, limiting fluid
removal. He underwent Holter monotoring where he was
predominantly in an ectopic atrial rhythm with  episodes up to
14hrs in duration of atrial tachycardia. He was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 528**] and was started on amiodarone after declining
invasive procedures to further characterize/treat his rhythm.
.
He presented to [**Hospital 974**] hospital on [**2737-11-5**] complaining of
generalized weakness and fatigue where initial vitals were 98.2
82/53, HR 129, and 98%RA. EKG revealed regular narrow complex
tachycardia. He was felt to be volume overloaded on exam. He
underwent hemodialysis on Saturday with removal of 1kg of fluid.
Cardiology recommended starting dobutamine for hypotension. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] on 5 of dobutamine with 2PIV.
.
On arrival to CCU, blood pressure was 71/40, HR 140s regular
narrow complex tachycardia, respiratory rate of 20 with O2 sat
mid 90s on room air. EKG showed narrow complex tachycardia with
rate of 148 with long R-P interval.  He was given adesonine 6mg
and then 12mg without significant change in rate (130s) or
rhythm.  Bedside TTE showed hyperdynamic LV and dilated RV with
adequate wall motion and moderate/severe TR. He was then given 2
mg versed and underwent DCCV 200J after which he transiently
went into an atrial ectopic rhythm with rate in 80s and then
atrial fibrillation with rates in 80s-90s. His blood pressure
improved to 88/50 and then later to 90s/50s.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2737-11-6**] 2D-ECHO - There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Normal LV function. Dilated and hypertrophied RV with
pressure and volume overload. Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the findings of
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2737-4-18**], there are now
signs of worsening RV pressure and volume overload.
.
[**2737-11-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Bilateral effusions slighly
increased since [**10-19**]. Old displaced anterior third rib
fracture. Intact sternal wires. Left subclavian stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
77M with medical history that includes non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy thought to be secondary to velcade/rituxan (now
with normalized left ventricular function), history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, supraventricular
tachycardia, severe tricuspid regurgitation, ESRD secondary to
Waldenstrom??????s macroglobulinemia, and metastatic prostate cancer
who [**Hospital 24723**] transferred from [**Hospital 974**] Hospital with hemodynamically
unstable supraventricular tachycardia with improvement in blood
pressure following electrical cardioversion.
.
# SUPRAVENTRICULAR, NARROW-COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA - The patient
presented with a regular, narrow complex tachycardia with
predominantly no P (or P in QRS). Adenosine did not terminate
(as typically occurs in AVNRT; he received 6 mg IV push followed
by 12 mg IV push without resolve) his rhythm or bring out P
waves (as typically occurs in atrial tachycardia). In the past
he was not interested in formal EP studies and potential
ablation but this was re-addressed this admission. Following
electrical cardioversion, his rhythm converted to atrial
fibrillation with a HR in the 80-90 bpm range; he reverted back
to an atypical tachyarrhythmia with a rate of 130-140 bpm within
1-2 hours following cardioversion. He was prepared for an
electrophysiology study on [**2737-11-8**] given his persistent rhythm
issues. He was started on Amiodarone 100 mg IV loading followed
by a 0.5 mcg/min continuous infusion with improvement in his HR
to the 100-120s with improvement in his BP to the 80/60s range.
We initially held his AV-nodal blocking agents. His TSH on
admission was 6.4. We also initially held his anticoagulation
(indication being atrial fibrillation) on admission, given that
his INR was 5.4 - and he received 3 mg Vitamin K PO x 1 given
his supratherapeutic INR and the need for an EP study. On
[**2737-11-8**] he went to the Electrophysiology lab and underwent an
AVNRT ablation with successful ablation of his re-entry pathway;
although the passage of the wire was difficult given his
wide-open tricuspid regurgitation. He was also transitioned to
Amiodarone 200 mg PO daily following the procedure, however, he
developed thrombocytopenia which was thought to be related to
the IV amiodarone load he received, and this was briefly
discontinued. After the procedure, he remained predominantly in
NSR with frequent PACs but had some episodes of AFib.  Prior to
discharge, he had reverted back into Afib and will be restarted
on amiodarone in an attempt to maintain NSR.  The
thrombocytopenia was thought to be related to the IV amiodarone
as he had previously tolerated IV amio with no observed drop in
platelets.
.
# HYPOTENSION - The patient presented with hypotension in the
setting of a supra-ventricular tachyarrhythmia, improved
following electrical cardioversion initially, but then he
spontaneously reverted to an atypical tachyarrhythmia with a
blood pressure in the 70/50 mmHg range. While he met SIRS
criteria on admission, there was no clear source of infection at
that time. Culture data was obtained on admission, which was
unrevealing, and we held off on empiric antibiotics. His
admission CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions with no
evidence of consolidation. His hypotension did improved with
cardioversion and with initiation of anti-arrhythmic medication.
He notably has blood pressures in the 80/60 mmHg range while at
dialysis, per his records; without notable symptoms.
.
# DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION -
The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with a
previous ejection fraction of 50-55% on most recent
echocardiogram (prior LVEF was 20% while on chemotherapy
agents). He has stage III/IV NYHA heart failure and appeared to
be volume overloaded on exam when admitted (lower extremity
edema, JVD in setting of moderate-severe TR). His labs (elevated
BNP) and imaging studies (pleural effusions, mild pulmonary
edema) supported these findings. He appeared to have moderate
pulmonary artery hypertension with a dilated right ventricle and
severe (4+) tricuspid regurgitation with overall worsened right
ventricular function compared to his prior exam; with abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload (LVEF 55%). The development of his
tachyarrhythmia likely contributed to this acute decompensation.
He has not been on ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] therapy (creatinine 3.1 on
hemodialysis). We initially held beta-blocker therapy given his
hypotension; his home dose being Metoprolol succinate 250 mg PO
daily. This was restarted fir rate control when he returned to
Afib.  Nephrology was consulted given the concern for volume
overload and the need for ultrafiltration. We were only able to
remove fluid by ultrafiltration and his volume status slowly
improved during admission, he will continue to have fluid
removed by ultrafiltration at HD after discharge.
.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: During this admission, his platelets trended
down from 100-150 at admission to 15 on HD5. The patient did not
have any bleeding.  HIT antibody was negative, and the patient
has been receiving heparin at dialysis routinely, making HIT
unlikely. No evidence of DIC on labs. Hematology was consulted,
and he was treated with prednisone 50mg which was quickly
tapered down and the patient's platetets improved. The etiology
of his thrombocytopenia was thought to be antibody-mediated
amiodarone toxicity from the IV amiodarone load he received at
admission. Hematology recommended avoiding PO amiodarone if
possible, although this will be necessary to control his rate.
At admission, he had been on PO amiodarone and had maintained
his platelet count.
.
# ESRD ON HEMODIALYSIS - Thought to be secondary to light chain
cast nephropathy from Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, on
hemodialysis since [**2733**]. He presented with volume overload, but
without significant metabolic derangements warranting urgent
dialysis. Nephrology was consulted and he continued to receive
HD on a TuThSa this admission. He was maintained on Nephrocaps 1
tablet PO daily and all medications were renally dosed.
.
# PROSTATE CANCER - The patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
for castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer that has been
refractory to Docetaxel with a rising PSA (most recently 1883 in
[**2737-9-28**]) on Zytiga and prednisone at home. He has also
received radiation to his right hip in the past for metastatic
disease.  We continued his home Oxycodone medication (as needed)
for pain control given his bone metastasis.
.
# ANEMIA/LEUKOPENIA - His anemia and leukopenia are stable
compared to prior recent labs and are thought to be due to bone
marrow involvement of his prostate cancer; less likely due to
Waldenstrom's. His counts were serially trended on this
admission.
.
# CODE STATUS - FULL CODE (discussed with patient)
.
# TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES:
1. Will need INR monitored - was therapeutic at discharge and he
will be continued on home dose of 1 mg daily
2. Currently on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday hemodialysis
schedule
3. [**Month (only) 255**] need uptitration of his Metoprolol dose if tachycardia
persists. We decreased from 250 to 100 mg daily because of
hypotension.
4. Should have platelets monitored after discharge to ensure
that he is not thrombocytopenic; given that he is going home on
Amiodarone.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24658**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission at
[**Hospital1 22**].  You were admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit because your
heart was beating very fast and your blood pressure was low.  We
treated you with an antiarrhythmic drug called amiodarone and
performed an ablation procedure in an attempt to prevent this
event from happening again.  You tolerated the procedure well.
You also continued to receive dialysis during your admission to
remove extra fluid that was causing swelling in your arms and
legs. Your platelet count dropped and have now increased again.
You did not have any signs that you were bleeding. You will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week and will need to get your
platelet count followed regularly.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
1. Change metoprolol to tartrate and increase the dose to 50 mg
three times a day to lower your heart rate
2. START Amiodarone to slow your heart rate and keep you in a
normal rhythm.
