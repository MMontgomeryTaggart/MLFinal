Brief Hospital Course:
33M PMH ESRD on HD presenting with hypertensive urgency,
nausea/vomiting after missing dialysis.
.
# Hypertensive urgency: Hypertension in the setting of inability
to tolerate his medications due to nausea and the patient
missing his last session of dialysis.  Initially started on
labetalol gtt in the MICU.  Without evidence of end organ
ischemia, with negative CT head, no ECG changes, cardiac enzymes
negative.  He was continued on his outpt regimen (BB, ACEI), CCB
was titrated up prior to discharge.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Resolved with Kayexalate. Rreceived Insulin 10
units with dextrose, Calcium gluconate, Kayexalate 30 gm in ED.
He underwent HD per his outpt regimen.
.
# ESRD on HD: Thought to be secondary to due to hypertensive
nephropathy.  Resumed on outpt schedule of MWF HD.
.
# Nausea/Vomiting: Resolved. Recent sick contacts suggesting
viral gastroenteritis. Also likely component of uremia. LFT and
lipase unremarkable (laboratories slighly hemolyzed).  Ruled out
for MI with enzymes.  Symptoms improved on discharge.
