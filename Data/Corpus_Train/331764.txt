   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 32F with Type 1 DM presenting with DKA.
   .
   # DKA
 Patient admitted with DKA. Elevated HgbA1c indicateds poor
   control of blood sugars, was previously followed by [**Last Name (un) 257**] but has not
   been seen recently. Gap was closed and bicarb had normalized somewhat
   but repeat labs this am show widened gap and decreased bicarb,
   worsening acidosis. She was also unable to tolerate POs with nausea and
   vomiting. Etiology appears to have been nonspecific illness causing N/V
   which have persisted, as pt reports adherence to her insulin and there
   is no other obvious source of infection. Per report pt does have a h/o
   insulin non-adherence. Other possible etiologies include infection
   although denies focal symptoms, does have elevated WBC but stable,
   afebrile.
   -- Will restart  insulin gtt at 4 units
   -- Continue PO challenge as tolerated
   -- DC SC insulin while on gtt
   -- q1-2h FSG
   -- q4-6h chemistries
   -- continue D51/2NS with K. Will recheck K at 10am
   -- reglan and zofran prn nausea
   -- [**Last Name (un) 257**] c/s
   -- will also check UA and urine cx to eval source of infxn given mod
   bacteria on UA, no prior cx
   .
   # Factor VIII inhibitor - s/p rituximab and steroids
   -- avoid sQ heparin, monitor for bleeding
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**1-28**] DKA, but other possible etiologies include
   diabetic gastroparesis. Given temporal association with DKA, most
   likely etiology.
   - prn Reglan, Zofran
   # Hypertension: Now normotensive but was hypertensive overnight.  Was
   likely [**1-28**] agitation, N/V. Will follow. No know prior h/o HTN and was
   not previously on any antihypertensives. She is young with no known h/o
   cardiovascular disease.
