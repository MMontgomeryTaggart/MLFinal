   HPI: This is a 83yoF with COPD on 3L home O2 and diastolic CHF who
   represents after having being discharged to her NF earlier today after
   admission for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of COPD
   exacerbation and HAP. Per pt's daughter, the NF called her b/c pt was
   combative and refusing her meals which usually happens in the setting
   hypercarbia. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 52**] ED for further evaluation.

   Furosemide 40mg IV x 1, Vancomycin 1g IV x 1.

   labs:
   ABG 7.25/116/74 on 2L NC
   Studies:
   Admission CXR: A right upper extremity PICC line is again noted with
   its tip in the approximate location of the superior vena cava.
   Cardiomegaly is again noted with small bilateral pleural effusions.
   There is improved aeration in the lower lungs with mild residual
   bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of CHF or pneumothorax.
   The mediastinal contour is unchanged. Osseous structures are stable.
   IMPRESSION:
   Cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusions, likely small
   amount of bibasilar atelectasis. Improved aeration at the lung bases.
   TTE [**3198-11-16**]:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
   aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic valve
   stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Increased
   PCWP.
   A/P: This is a 83 yoF who returns to the hospital in hypercarbic
   respiratory failure after very recent admission for the same earlier
   today.
