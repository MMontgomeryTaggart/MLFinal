Chief Complaint:  Respiratory failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   61 yof in USOH until 1 day PTA when developed abd pain radiating to
   back, chest discomfort, wheezing and dyspnea
 went to [**Hospital1 52**] ER.
   Associated symptoms of diarrhea and nausea.
   [**Hospital1 52**] ER evaluation demonstrated HR= 120, SaO2= 97% RA.  Concern raised
   for mast cell degranulation episode --> received usual medication
   combination (including epinephrine1:1000 subcutaneous; dilaudid,
   benedryl, solumedrol, zofran, ativan, albuterol nebulizer.  Initial
   improvement of symptoms followed by recurrence
 Admitted to medical
   [**Hospital1 **].
   This AM, experienced worsening SOB.  Intubated for respiratory distress
   (no laryngeal edema noted by Anesthesiologist at the time of
   intubation).  Transferred to MICU service for further evaluation and
   management.
   Upon arrival to MICU, pt. intubated, sedated, but able to communicate
   with head nods.  Notes abd pain and chest pain which she describes with
   usual episodes attributed to MCDS
 improving.  Denies dyspnea.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, mast cell degranulation syndrome (MCDS).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 intubated.  No significant laryngeal swelling
   noted at time of intubation.  Lung exam clear.  Continue current
   medications.  Work towards SBT and hopefully safe extubation soon.
   MAST CELL DEGRANULATION SYNDROME
mild flare currently.  Continue usual
   meds.  Hope for rapid resolution.
   VOCAL CORD DYSFUCTION
   may contribute dyspnea.
   CHEST PAIN SYNDROME
 chronic.
   HYPERTENSION --  attributed to distress and epinephrine.  Improved.
   DIARRHEA
 stable.
   FLUIDS
 euvolemic.  Monito I/O.  maintain balance.
   RENAL FUNCTION
 preserved.  Monitor BUN, creatitnine.
