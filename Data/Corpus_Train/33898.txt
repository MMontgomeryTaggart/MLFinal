Brief Hospital Course:
26 y/o with past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes
mellitus presents to [**Hospital1 22**] with severe DKA, with bicarb level
less than assay.  The patient was admitted to the ICU.

# DKA:  A femoral line was placed in the ED where she was given
IVF and an insulin drip.  In the MICU, the IVF and the gtt were
continued, titrating the insulin gtt to BG <150, once BG <200,
started D5 drip.  Upon arrival, pt felt short of breath (her
presenting complaint), but this was most likely [**1-12**] profound
metabolic acidosis.  As her acidemia corrected, her breathing
normalized.  Her anion gap continued to close during her stay in
the MICU.  On [**8-18**], started long acting glargine as well as
sliding scale and was able to turn off drip. Once off the gtt,
she was stable for the floor, however, she continued to require
very active repletion of her lytes- K, mag, and phos.
.
No evidence of infection as a precipitating factor.  Although pt
had a small leukocytosis, blood and urine cultures were
unrevealing.  CXR was wnl.  The elev WBC may be secondary to a
stress response.  Urine HCG was negative.  Urine HCG was
negative.
.
# Bulemia - This episode of DKA was most likely related to the
patient regularly skipping doses of her short acting insulin.
The patient says she only consistently takes her long acting
insulin; she almost never takes her short acting insulin. The
patient's diabetes is complicated by bulemia.  The patient
admits to skipping her insulin doses in order to loose weight.
The patient's diabetes is very poorly controlled.  Her HbA1c is
14.9 on this admission.  She has an endocrinologist and a
therapist that she sees regularly for her "diabulemia."
However, she is moving to [**State 1155**] this month.  We have
arranged for follow up with an endocrinologist in the area 1
week after discharge.  The patient has information on counseling
services in the area, and used to see a therapist that she liked
in the area.  She is commited to taking her insulin as directed
in the short term.  She admitts that she often has difficulty
staying commited to this over the long term, but that therapy
has been very helpful and she has made progress.

# Constipation/Gastroporesis: patient with evidence of
significant constipation with enlarged stomach.  Unclear is this
is an acute or chronic process, such as gastroparesis.  Started
a bowel regimen and pt had a BM on day 2.  Also, had standing
reglan.  Pt tolerated a regular diet.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitting with shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting
and fatigue and were found to have diabetic ketoacidosis.  You
stated that you were not taking your short acting insulin

You state that the major barrier to your medication compliance
is your eating disorder.  You admit to skipping doses of the
short acting insulin to loose weight.  You are aware of the need
to continue therapy for your eating disorder and of the
complications of not taking your insulin regularly.   You had no
evidence of infection.  No other precipitating factors were
indentified.  You were treated in the ICU where your blood
sugars normalized and your acidosis resolved.  We recommend that
you check your blood sugars and take your long and short acting
insulin as directed.
.
We recommend that you take 30 units of levemir at breakfast and
novolog 2-14 units 4 times a day as needed according to the
attached insulin sliding scale. Please check and record your
blood sugars 4 times a day.  This information will be important
for your new endocrinologist.  Please check for ketones in your
urine on a daily basis.  You can get ketone testing strips over
the counter at any pharmacy.  If your ketones are moderate to
