   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3331**] is an 84 year old female with CAD, AS, diastolic CHF
   admitted with a worsening shortness of breath.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient recently discharged from [**Hospital1 17**] with pneumonia,
   treated with levaquin and 14 day course of vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   completed on [**9-17**].  Now with leukocytosis, though denies fevers or
   chills.  Concern for pneumonia (hospital acquired given that she was at
   rehab and recently discharged).  Although increasing O2 requirements
   may be due to patient's inability to clear secretions due to weak
   cough/ deconditioning.  Has a history of PE, though currently with
   supratherapeutic INR.  Has history of diastolic heart failure with
   elevated BNP (though unknown baseline), elevated JVP, b/l LE edema
   (stable), and "Mild CHF" on CXR, which may be contributing to her SOB
   though did not tolerate diuresis in ED due to low BP.  Given
   leukocytosis, would favor treating pneumonia and then considering
   diuresis in a few days if she fails to respond.
   - continue albuterol, atrovent
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - frequent suctioning
   - consider diuresis if BP tolerates it
   - send sputum sample
   - PA and lateral CXR
   .
   2. A. fib.  Patient developed A. fib post-operatively after CABG on
   [**3237-7-28**] and has been treated with coumadin.  Now found to have
   supratherapeutic INR.  Currently in NSR.
   - continue amiodarone
   - hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold metoprolol for now given hypotension in ED
   .
   3.  CAD.  S/p CABG on [**3237-7-28**].  Initial set of cardiac enzymes showed
   normal CK and TropT of 0.05.  Not complaining of CP and EKG appears
   unchanged.
   - aspirin, simvastatin
   - hold lisinopril, metoprolol given hypotension in ED
   .
   4.       Hypotension.  Patient had hypotension to 70s overnight, after
   receiving lasix in ED.  From prior notes, appears to commonly have SBP
   of 100 or 110.  Given concern for pulmonary infection, will given fluid
   boluses to maintain SBP > 90.  Due to hypotension, unable to diurese
   patient.
   - fluid boluses to maintain SBP > 90
   5.       Sytolic murmur.  Patient with systolic murmur on exam.
   Recently had aortic valve replacement.  Echo following surgery showed
   1+ AR, and [**11-19**]+MR.
   - consider echo
   Ppx: therapeutic INR for A. fib, bowel regimen, home PPI
