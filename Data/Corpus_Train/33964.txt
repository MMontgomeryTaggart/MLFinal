Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 387**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Hemodialysis (CVVH)

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 68 year old female with a history of systolic
congestive heart failure (EF 15%), ESRD on HD, CAD and DMII who
presents with two days of worsening shortness of breath.  The
patient has had multiple admissions to this hospital between
[**2914-4-22**] and present for shortness of breath and was most
recently discharged on [**2914-7-21**].  The patient reports that she
was in her usual state of health until two days prior to
admission.  She received dialysis as [**Date Range 3083**] on [**2914-7-28**].  She
began to feel short of breath on [**2914-7-29**] with associated dyspnea
on exertion and worsening orthopnea.  She reports that she has
had a cough productive of clear sputum for the past month but
this has not worsened acutely over the past two days.  She
reports that she does have pressure in her chest and that this
has been present essentially constantly over the past 48 hours.
The chest pressure is associated with her shortness of breath.
It is not clearly associated with exertion.  The patient reports
three pillow orthopnea which has not clearly worsened.  She does
report a worsening of her dyspnea on exertion.  She says that
her daughter helps her taker her medications and that she has
been compliant to her knowledge.  She does not report any
dietary indiscretion. The patient uses 3 L oxygen by nasal
cannula at home and has not needed to increase her O2.  She also
has been compliant with her home CPAP. The patient reports that
she presented to the emergency room on [**2914-7-29**].  At that time
she had a chest xray which showed improved but persistent
pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions.  She had one set of
cardiac enzymes which were notable for a troponin of 0.21 which
is within her baseline.  She was discharged with plans to follow
up with her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] reports that her shortness of breath
acutely worsened the following morning and she represented to
the emergency room.
.
In the emergency room her initial vital signs were T: 95. HR:
100 BP: 131/68 RR: 24 O2: 95% on 100% NRB (88% on RA). Initially
she was hemodynamically stable but while in the emergency room
her blood pressure decreased to the 70s systolic transiently and
she required fluid bolus.  She received 0.5 mg IV ativan and was
subsequently noted to be more somnolent.  ABG performed revealed
a ph of 7.31, PCO2 of 70 and PO2 of 73.  She was placed on BIPAP
with improvement in her mental status.  She had a CXR which
showed a new right basilar opacity and increasing pulmonary
congestion.  She received 20 mg IV lasix with minimal urine
output.  She received ceftriaxone 1 gram, azithromycin 500 mg
PO, Aspirin 325 mg PO, tylenol 500 mg PO and levofloxacin 750 mg
IV.  Her EKG showed a ventricularly paced rhythm with no
significant changes from prior tracings.  A left IJ central line
was attempted with misplacement in the carotid.  Pressure was
held.  While in the emergency room her blood pressure improved
to the 100s systolic.  Her mental status improved and at the
time of transfer she was satting well on 3 L NC.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 2**] for further management.
.
On review of systems she reports that her shortness of breath is
slightly improved from this morning.  She continues to have
constant chest pressure.  She denies fevers, chills,
lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
dysuria, hemturia, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia,
leg swelling.  She does have persistent left stump pain which is
unchanged from baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Continued management
with hemodialysis. Due to mild hypotension, lisinopril was held
and carvedilol was continued.
2. CKD STAGE V ON HD: stable.
3. HYPOTENSION: Resolved
4. ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Appears to be secondary to
sedation after receiving benzodiazepines - resolved. During her
ICU admission she was treated empirically for PNA, but the
antibiotics were discontinued when it was determined that she
did not have PNA.
5. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Stable
6. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Stable.
7. DIABETES MELLITUS YYPE II: Stable.
8. ISCHEMIC ANKLE ULCER: Followed by podiatry, no role for
revascularization, and they recommended continuing local wound
care.
9. PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE: The patient will be continued on
aspirin, ACE if she can tolerate by BP, warfarin, per report did
not tolerate statin therapy.
10. END OF LIFE CARE: I had an extensive conversation with the
patients daughter, [**Name (NI) 3581**] [**Name (NI) **] the details of which can be
found in the OMR note dated [**2914-8-2**]. In brief, she is not ready
for hospice yet, but is open to the concept, she did agree that
the patient's code status would be DNR/DNI. A palliative care
consult was obtained so that the daughter will have an
established relationship when the time comes to transition to
comfort measures.Note, the patient defers all medical decision
making to her daughter, and was not part of these conversations.
