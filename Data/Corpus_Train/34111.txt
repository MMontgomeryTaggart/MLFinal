Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**12-13**] for cardiac catheterization in
preparation for aortic valve replacement.  He was found to have
left main coronary artery disease, as well as stenoses in the
right, and LAD coronary arteries.  Heparin was initiated and the
patient was admitted for AVR, CABG.  The patient was brought to
the operating room on [**12-16**] where he underwent AVR, CABGx3.
Vancomycin was administered for perioperative antibiotic
prophylaxis due to prolonged [**Hospital **] hospital stay.  Please see
dictated operative note for full details.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for further
recovery and invasive monitoring.  The patient was initially
extubated on POD 0, however required reintubation for
respiratory failure.  He was re-extubated on POD 1.  Vasoactive
drips were weaned off. The patient was diuresed toward his
preoperative weight.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  Physical therapy was
consulted for assistance with post-operative strength and
mobility.  Coumadin was resumed for atrial fibrillation.  The
patient had an episode of bradycardia which progressed to a PEA
arrest on POD 6.  ACLS protocol was initiated.  The patient was
re-intubated, CPR was performed, multiple drips were started and
the patient was resuscitated.  The patient stabilized, pressors
were weaned and he was extubated again.  The electrophysiology
service was consulted and determined that the patient was not a
candidate for a permanent pacemaker.  The patient was eventually
transferred to the floor and the remainder of the hospital
course was uneventful.  He was discharged on POD 12 to [**Hospital1 27834**] Rehab Hospital for pulmonary rehabilitation.
