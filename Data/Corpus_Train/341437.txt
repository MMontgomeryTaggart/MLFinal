   Assessment and Plan
   patient with known history of diabetes now admit with DKA in the
   setting of difficult accesss to insulin.  She additionally had evidence
   of significant ischemia and chest pain at the time of admisssion.
   Arguing against a signficant state of insulin resistance is that
   patient had rapid resolution of anioin gap with treatment start with IV
   insulin.
