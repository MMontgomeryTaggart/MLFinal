   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 48 yo M with HIV, HCV presenting with fevers and
   hypotension concerning for sepsis.  Now has worsening rash.
   .
   #Fevers - unclear source for infection at this time, although recent
   injection drug use concerning for bacteremia/endocarditis, with
   differential including staph, partially treated strep (pt received
   penicillin for syphilis), or culture negative pathogens.  Fever,
   hypotension, and rash would be concerning for a toxic-shock syndrome
   picture, but again, patient would be likely culture positive.  Other
   likely sources would be viral respiratory infection, PNA less likely
   given clear CXR. LP without evidence of meningitis.  U/A is positive,
   representing possible UTI, pyelonephritis, or spillover of infection
   from the bloodstream.  However, this would be covered by antibiotics.
   Given ECG conduction problems, considering [**Name (NI) **], myocarditis.
   -f/u nasal aspirate for influenza
   -continue Daptomycin because of vanco allergy, Zosyn, add Clinda per ID
   recs X 48 hours
   -f/u cultures, [**Name (NI) 2445**] serologies, C. Diff
   - Tylenol for fevers alternating with Ibuprofen for liver disease
   .
   #Hypotension - concerning for sepsis given high fevers.   [**Last Name (un) 552**] stim
   test normal
   -continue with antibiotics
   -continue levophed with goal MAP >65, attempt to wean as tolerated
   -continue IVF to maintain CVP 8-10.
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy
 Lower than baseline.  No current
   evidence of bleeding. DIC labs negative.  Ddx: primary HIV effects,
   drug (interferon, HAART) effects, or consumptive process/dilution.
   -monitor PLT, coags
   -transfuse if Hct<21, Plt<[**10-27**]
   .
   Rash- Most likely drug rash, followed by viral exanthem, and toxic
   shock syndrome much less likely.  No ocular/mucous membrane involvement
   concerning for  [**Doctor Last Name 2470**]-[**Location (un) 725**].
   -          Recheck diff for eosinophilia
   -          Sarna lotion for symptomatic relief.  Diphenhydramine for
   same.
   -          If skin grows painful, or eyes/mouth become involved, derm
   consult
   #HIV/HCV - followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2426**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2427**] of ID service.  LFT's at
   baseline.
   -continue [**Doctor Last Name 797**] with kaletra and truvada
   -hold off on ribaviron for now per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2426**]
   .
   #Anemia - per patient [**2-13**] interferon/ribaviron therapy, gets aranesp
   injestions.  No evidence of acute bleeding and HCT close to baseline.
   -monitor HCT, PLT
   #PPX: pneumoboots (hold heparin given thrombocytopenia), bowel reg if
   needed
   .
   #FEN - regular diet, replete lytes prn
   .
   #Code Status - Full
