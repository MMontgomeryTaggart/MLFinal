History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 75 year old female with known aortic stenosis
for the last several years. Serial echocardiograms have shown
progressive aortic stenosis. Over the last several months, she
has admitted to worsening exertional shortness of breath. She
has no history of syncope or CHF. In preperation for upcoming
aortic valve replacement, she underwent cardiac cathterization
which revealed single vessel coronary artery disease - 70%
lesion in the mid circumflex. Her coronary arteries were
otherwise normal. Her LVEF on ECHO is 60%. Preoperative carotid
ultrasound found no significant disease.

Pertinent Results:
[**3383-4-2**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The leaflets ratio is
close 1-1.5 and the c-[**Month (only) **] distance 1.6cm c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
predisposition.

Post_BYPASS:
Normal Right ventricular sytolic function. Overall LVEF 50-55%.
There is a bioprosthesis in the native aortic position, seated
well and functioning well with a peak and a mean gradient of 20
and 15 respectively.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient firstname **] was admitted and underwent aortic valve replacement
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, he was brought
to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. She
maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day two. On postoperative day three, she
experienced bouts of atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone therapy was
initiated with success back into a normal sinus rhythm.  For the
remainder of her hospital stay, she remained in a normal sinus
rhythm. Beta blockade was advanced as tolerated. She required a
short course of antibiotics for a right arm cellulitis. Her
hospital course was otherwise uneventul. She continued to make
clinical improvements with diuresis and was medically cleared
for discharge to rehab on postoperative day five.
