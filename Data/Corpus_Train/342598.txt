   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo F with h/o SLE, ESRD on HD (prior PD), malignant HTN and
   abdominal pain admitted with HTN urgency. The source of the abdominal
   pain may be her
   HTN: She has a history of labile malignant hypertension. Given her
   complicated history her goal blood pressure target is < 180/100 mmHg.
   Her home regimen includes aliskiren, labetalol, clonidine patch,
   hydralazine, and nifedipine. She has had multiple admissions to MICU
   for labile BP (see last D/c summary)
    -          clonidine patch
   -          restart PO meds as she tolerates
   -          Goal BP <180/100 mmHg
   >Hemodialysis: Received HD today (T, Th, Sat schedule), notably her K
   on admission was in normal range. Will cont home renal regimen. Unclear
   why she has ascites will confer with renal.
   >Abdominal pain: unclear source, she has had an extensive workup
   including ex lap. Abd CT reveals only ascites and still with in
   dwelling PD line.  The peritoneal fluid is consistent with infection
   (ie 2^nd bact peritonitis). She has a nidus for infection in the PD
   catheter. We will need to discuss with renal whether they want to keep
   this cath in place.
   - Cover for 2^nd BP: Vancomycin + GNR coverage: Levoflox and
   Metronidazole  (Renal dosing). With next dose HD.
   - Will f/u clx data
   - Will d/w with ID and renal: appropriate coverage  (IV vs peritoneal
   instillation) and whether PD cath needs to be removed.
   >SVC clot and left subclavian thrombosis:  related to catheter with neg
   anti phos wrk up. She has a  hx of non compliance with coumadin and she
   is subtherapeutic at present,. Clot was in [**3351**] but she will need to be
   antii-coagulated, will start hep gtt and add back coumadin.
