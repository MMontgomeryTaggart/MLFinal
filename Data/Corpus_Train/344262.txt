   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 41 yo M with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with
   Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism who presents with
   his third episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection.
   # Recurrent altered mental status: DDX includes infection (less likely
   given this is the third episode in the last few weeks and work up for
   infection has been negative, currently leukocytosis or fevers), stroke
   or head bleed (unlikely for similar reason and prior CT x2 and MRI
   brain all negative), encephalopathy (likely), hyponatremia (could be
   contributing given sodium of 120 is lower than he has been given he
   restarted diuretics yesterday), sleep disorder (given all episodes
   occur first thing in the AM).
   -for hepatic encephalopathy- dose lactulose q2hrs until bowel movements
   then back down with goal bowel movements 5-6 per day, continue
   rifaximine
   -for hyponatremia- repeat labs in 4 hrs. If still hyponatremic, will
   need repletion. Hold diuretics.
   -sleep disorder- continuous oxygen monitoring, ABG when awake and
   extubated for baseline. sleep study needed but may not be able to do in
   house on the weekend. Consider auto titrating CPAP.
   -infection- unlikely but could consider diagnostic para if not
   improving. Two diagnostic [**Doctor First Name 3560**] this admission were negative
   # alkylosis: Would think with altered mental status, that his CO2 would
   be high causing an acidosis not alkylosis with low CO2. Could imply a
   sleep disturbance as cause. See above.
   -monitor ABG
   -currently changing to PS ventilation and will resend ABG in 30 mins.
   -ween vent as tolerated.
   -has been extubated quickly on prior episodes.
   # ESLD: Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis.
   -continue lactulose as above, continue rifaximine
   -hold diuretics
   -continue ppx cipro for SBP
   -follow up hepatology recs
   # Pulmonary HTN: continue sildenafil. [**Month (only) 47**] not be able to get iloprost
   while on vent. Will discuss with respiratory and pharmacy.
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # FEN: NPO for now. Monitor lytes as above
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home reg, bowel reg as above
   # Code: full
