Chief Complaint:  Milrinone administration
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 86M with cardiomyopathy (EF 15-20%), CAD s/p PCI's x 3,
   mod-severe AS, prior MVR, and atrial flutter who presents with acute on
   chronic renal failure on outpatient follow up. He was recently admitted
   to hospital for increased fatigue and diarrhea and discharged on
   [**2640-10-11**]. This hospitalization was complicated by hypotension requiring
   fluid resuscitation in the MICU. He was discharged home on torsemide 20
   mg [**Hospital1 **] which was an increase from previous home regimen of lasix 20mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. He presented to his cardiologist's office for routine labs. His
   creatinine increased to 4.5 with increased lower extremity edema.
   .
   In the ED, VS were stable. EKG showed RBBB with no acute changes. His
   creatinine increased from 2.9 on [**2640-10-11**] to 4.9. Patient denied
   dietary indiscretions. He was started on a new medication, minocycline
   prior to having his labs drawn for a pruritic rash on his torso. Other
   relatively new medications include coumadin for his atrial flutter.
   .
   He was admitted to the [**Hospital1 2208**] service where his ACE was held given renal
   failure. He was started on hydral for afterload reduction and lasix gtt
   for diuresis. He is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 340**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who recommended milrinone
   + lasix gtt for treatment of his decompensated end stage CHF. He was
   transferred to the CCU for further management.
   .
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
   pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
   pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent
   fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea
   on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
   syncope or presyncope. He admits to significant chronic lower extremity
   edema.

   Imaging: TTE 11/18?08
   The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20% %).
   The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global
   free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
   level. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
   moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to
   moderate ([**11-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral
   valve prosthesis is present. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. The pulmonic
   valve leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   ECG: [**2640-10-16**]: Atrial flutter, rate 71, nl axis, wide QRS, RBBB, ST
   depression in I, avL
   Assessment and Plan
   86M with cardiomyopathy (EF 15-20%), CAD, AS, prior MVR, and atrial
   flutter who presents with acute on chronic renal failure and worsening
   lower extremity edema.
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy
   with an estimated EF of 15-20% in [**9-26**]. Minimal response to lasix gtt.
   BNP is [**Numeric Identifier 6634**] up from [**Numeric Identifier 6424**] on [**2640-10-5**]. Will begin milrinone to improve
   forward flow and encourage diuresis.
   - Milrinone, 50 microgram/kg bolus over 15 min
   - Milrinone gtt at 0.375 microgram/kg/min continuous infusion. If
   tolerates dose, can increase to 0.5 microgram/kg/min overnight.
   - Milrinone may drop SVR; If so, neo gtt and CVL. [**Month (only) 56**] also exacerbate
   aflutter. Will control with bblockers.
   - Increase lasix gtt to 12mg/min
   - monitor urine output and creatinine to assess response to milrinone
   - continue digoxin and ck drug level
   - fluid restrict; low salt diet
   - continue to hold lisinopril in setting of ARF
   .
   # CAD: ST depressions in I and avL. No complaints of CP or SOB. CKs
   flat and Tn's trending down from last admission.
   - continue ASA, statin, bblocker
   - holding ACE for renal failure
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr improved from admission 4.9 to
   4.5 (Baseline 2.7). Likely secondary to poor forward flow. FENA and
   Feurea indeterminate at 1.8, 35.5.
   - hold lisinopril for ARF
   - No eos in urine; unlikely to be AIN
   - monitor UO and creatinine on milrinone
   .
   #. Atrial Flutter:  Recently started on coumadin. INR subtherapeutic at
   1.3.
   - continue to monitor daily INR; goal [**12-22**]
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - bblocker for rate control
   .
   # HTN: continue bblocker
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   .
   #. Rash: Hx of pemphigus. Started on minocycline by outpatient derm.
   Biopsy completed.
   - continue to monitor; will follow up outpatient biopsy results
   - Restart minocycline after dig level results as can increase dig level
   in patient who metabolize dig through GI tract. Can also increase INR.
   Will monitor.
