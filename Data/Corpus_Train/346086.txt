TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   s/p ICD
   Firing
   24 Hour Events:
   Ablation - unable to get 2nd focus, changed pacer settings to kick in
   to ATP pace at 122, start on home amio dose and uptitrated BB.
   Bleeding from groin site after venous and arterial sheaths removed.
   New bruit -> US with AV fistula. Evaluated by vascular surgery - no
   plan for surgery unless uncontrollable bleeding, hypoperfusion to
   distal extremity or develops high output CHF. Otherwise usually heals
   on its own. NPO after MN just in case.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is an 82 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and multiple MIs,
   HTN, CHF EF 35%, afib, and sustained VT with ICD and subsequent
   catheter ablation treatment who presents with an episode of ICD firing,
   found to be in slow VT.
   .
   # CAD - The patient has a history of CAD with multiple MIs and is
   medically managed on atorvastatin, metoprolol, and isosorbide
   mononitrate. Will continue home meds for now. Ischemia unlikely as a
   cause for his ICD firing and slow VT however will complete a rule out
   for ACS.  No evidence for infection or volume overload on exam.
   - cycle CEs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - serial EKGs
   .
   # Pump - Currently euvolemic.  He has chronic systolic heart failure
   with an LVEF of 35%. No active issues.
   - continue home meds
   .
   # Rhythm - The pt is now s/p ICD firing. He was found to be in slow VT
   in the ED. He was able to be paced out of VT. He received a bolus of
   amiodarone and started on a gtt.
   - continue amiodarone gtt
   - monitor on telemetry
   - NPO after MN for possible ablation/EP study in AM, he has had several
   ablation procedures in the past but unclear how successful it may be
   given past unsuccessful attempts, will d/w EP
   - will d/w EP in AM about alternative antiarrhythmic for recurrent VT
   such as flecanide/mexilitine for long term, will d/w outpatient
   cardiologist
   .
   # Hypertension - Continue home meds. No active issues.
   .
   # h/o atrial fibrillation - Currently in sinus rhythm. Will continue
   home meds for now. Heparin gtt, hold Coumadin for now given possibility
   of study, follow INR.
   .
   # h/o DVT - heparin gtt, hold coumadin for now
   .
   # FEN - cardiac healthy diet, NPO after MN for possible EP
   study/ablation
   .
   # Access - PIV
   .
   # Code - full code

   # Dispo - CCU
