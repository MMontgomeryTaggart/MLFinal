Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 387**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
74 year-old woman with afib on coumadin, chronic diastolic CHF,
COPD, and GERD who presented to [**Hospital1 22**] [**Location (un) **] with N/V and was
found to be hypotensive in systolic 80s-90s.
.
Of note, patient was recently hospitalized [**Date range (3) 28914**] to
the cardiology service for afib with rvr associated with ST
depressions, troponin leak, and elevated BNP. She underwent TEE
with cardioversion which was complicated by hypoxia that
resolved with IV lasix drip diuresis. During this admission, she
also had N/V that was felt to be due to digoxin toxicity and
digoxin was discontinued.
.
Since being discharged from the hospital, she states that she
has been doing poorly. She has had ongoing N/V, having
difficulty keeping even water down. Reports pain in
mid-epigastrium. Also reports approximately 3 loose bowel
movements daily, had initially been bloody but not recently. She
carries a diagnosis of colitis, presumably crohn's but has not
followed up with repeat colonoscopy to confirm diagnosis. Feels
that she has lost 20 lbs over several months. She had not been
taking her asacol until recent hospital admission. She was seen
by her gastroenterologist today who noted BP to be 80/60 and
referred her to ED for hypotension and inability to tolerate
po's.
At [**Hospital1 22**] [**Location (un) **] ED, she was afebrile, HR 60s-90s, SBP 80s-90s,
satting high 90s-100% on 2L. She received 4mg iv zofran, 2mg iv
morphine, 5mg po oxycodone. EKG showed afib wtih ST depressions
diffusely. Trop was elevated to 0.116 (up from 0.07 on last
admission with Cr 1.2-1.5 at that time), Cr 1.38 (up from 0.9 on
discharge [**5-25**]), and Hct 45.6 (up from 35 on discharge [**5-25**]).
Dig level was low. U/A was bland. INR was 3.6. She was guaiac
positive on rectal exam. IV access was difficult; options for
central access were discussed but family declined. She was given
3L NS with little response in blood pressures. CT abdomen
reportedly showed no colitis or ischemic gut; there was some CBD
dilatation 16mm with some intrahepatic ductal dilatation. LFTs
were wnl.

[**2526-6-1**] Blood culture - pending
[**2526-6-1**] Urine culture - no growth
[**2526-6-2**] CMV viral load - pending
[**2526-6-3**] Stool cultures - pending
[**2526-6-3**] C.diff toxin - negative

IMAGING:
[**2526-6-1**] CXR (PORTABLE) - Cardiomegaly and mediastinal silhouette
are unchanged. There is minimal pulmonary vascular
re-distribution improved compared to prior. The right lower lobe
opacity has partially cleared. Right middle lobe opacity is also
partially cleared. The old rib fractures and compression
deformities are
again visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION: 74F with PMH significant for A.fib (on Coumadin),
chronic diastolic CHF, COPD, GERD who presented to [**Hospital1 22**] [**Location (un) **]
with nausea, emesis and was found to be hypotensive which
responded to IV hydration; occurring in the setting of her
chronic diarrhea issues with preliminary diagnosis of
inflammatory colitis.
.
# CHRONIC DIARRHEA COMPLAINTS - The patient has had on-going
complaints of watery, loose and intermittently bloody stools. A
sigmoidoscopy in [**7-/2525**] demonstrated sigmoid colitis with
biopsies noting mild inactive colitis and rare cryptic
abscesses; a sessile serrated adenoma and small internal
hemorrhoids. The patien't diarrhea complaints continued this
admission and she had notably poor PO intake resulting in
dehydration. Gastroenterology consulted and felt colonoscopy and
EGD was warranted, but felt that cardiac optimization would be
necessary before performing this procedure. Stool cultures and
C.diff toxin were reassuring. CMV viral load was pending at
discharge. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis did not demonstrate
evidence of active colitis and Mesalamine was continued in the
meantime. The differential still includes an inflammatory bowel
disorder vs. colonic ischemia. Conservative management was
recommended until an endoscopy can be performed in the future;
in [**5-3**] weeks, once her cardiac issues have stabilized.
.
# HYPOTENSION - Presented to [**Hospital1 22**] [**Location (un) **] with hypotension
80-90 mmHg which responded to IV fluids. She subsequently
developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in
this setting with resulting EKG findings suggestive of demand
ischemia and a troponin elevation to 0.10 with a flat CK-MB.
This was all improved with hydration, thought to be volume
losses in the setting of her diarrhea and nausea complaints. Her
Lasix was initially held in this setting and resumed at half
dosing on discharge.
.
# ELEVATED TROPONIN - Troponin elevated to 0.116 and 0.10 at
[**Hospital1 22**]; had previously been 0.07 in the setting of similar
creatinine. EKG showing ST depressions in V5-6. This was
attributed to demand ischemia from hypotension issues (as noted
above). Serial EKGs remained stable and no acute plaque rupture
was suspected. Her cardiac medications were optimized. We
continued her beta-blocker.
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - Status-post recent TEE with
cardioversion that was unsuccessful ([**2526-5-22**]). Currently in
A.fib on admission. INR supertherapeutic at 4.2 on admission. We
continued rate control with Metoprolol succinate 100 mg XL daily
once her blood pressure and volume status stabilized. We
deferred rhythm control given her recently failed cardioversion.
She presented with a supratherapeutic INR (3.8) and her Coumadin
was held. At discharge, this will be resumed.
.
# CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE - Known LVEF 55%. Mild
valvular disease 1+ MR, MR 1+ TR noted on recent 2D-Echo.
Outpatient regimen includes: beta-blocker, digoxin and Lasix. We
continued her Metoprolol and resumed her Digoxin. We resumed her
Lasix at half dose on discharge, given her improved volume
status.
.
# (?) CONCERN FOR PLASMA CELL DYSCRASIA - Prior sternal fracture
and L1 vertebroplaty in [**2523**]; concern on imaging at that time of
possible pathologic fracture component. She also has an SPEP
noting monoclonal free kappa (BJ-protein) is small amounts with
low immunoglobulin profile (4/[**2526**]). Normal TP, 30+ protein in
her admission U/A. Will need outpatient work-up for possible
plasma cell dyscrasia given recent weight loss concerns.
.
# DEPRESSION - We continued Citalopram.
.
# COPD - We continued Spiriva and Tiotroprium.
.
# GERD - Likely contributing to nausea or vomiting pre GI. We
continued her Ranitidine and added Omeprazole to her
medications. She will need outpatient endoscopy (as above).
.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES:
1. Monitoring of heart rate - known atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response; improved HR with hydration. Fluid
status needs to be closely monitored. Increased potential for
dehydration. Encourage PO intake at this point given euvolemic
status. Resumed Lasix 80 mg PO daily (half of prior dose).
2. Will be maintained on telemetry for now at rehab. Optimized
heart rate on beta-blocker and digoxin.
3. Known chronic nausea and chronic diarrhea complaints.
Gastroenterology feels this warrants upper and lower endoscopy
in the future; roughly 4-6 weeks following cardiac improvement.
Has follow-up scheduled with GI at [**Location (un) **] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8119**].
4. Has Cardiology follow-up scheduled on discharge.
5. Anticoagulation monitoring - held Coumadin dosing on
discharge given INR returned to [**Location 223**] level from being
supratherapeutic. Resume Coumadin dosing and monitor INR daily
for now.
7. Needs physical therapy. Likely able to ambulate to bathroom
with walker and sit in chair; monitor HR during these periods.
8. Known parotid tumor with need for repeat MR imaging in [**3-31**]
months.
9. ** UPEP and SPEP notably positive from last admission
(4/[**2526**]). Prior sternal fracture and L1 vertebroplaty in [**2523**];
concern on imaging at that time of possible pathologic fracture
component. She also has an SPEP noting monoclonal free kappa
(BJ-protein) is small amounts with low immunoglobulin profile
(4/[**2526**]). Normal TP, 30+ protein in her admission U/A. Will need
outpatient work-up for possible plasma cell dyscrasia given
recent weight loss concerns. Would recommend: repeat UPEP,
beta-microglobulin, free light chain analysis, LDH, CRP; also
consider possible periheral smear, marrow biopsy in the future;
monitor renal function closely and consider bone survery.
Scheduled with Heme-Onc for follow-up. **
.
** NOTE: The news about the positive UPEP and SPEP findings were
discussed in detail with the patient's daughter, [**Name (NI) 1057**] [**Name (NI) 14137**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 28915**]) who felt that they would rather pursue this
work-up for a plasma cell dyscrasia with the patient's primary
care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **], we scheduled Heme-Onc follow-up for
now. [**Doctor First Name 1057**] also noted that she would prefer her mother not be
informed of these findings until her work-up was completed and
the full spectrum of the clinical picture was investigated. We
respected her concerns. **
