Brief Summary of Patient History:
  Ms [**Known patient lastname 2945**] is a 43-year old woman with a history of
uncomplicated
MVR (bioprosthetic) and closure of PFO in [**2600-8-11**] presenting to
[**Doctor First Name 3093**] Hospital on [**9-5**] and transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] on [**9-8**] with
sternal wound pain and drainage.
  She presented to [**Doctor First Name 3093**] Hospital on [**9-5**] with a progressive,
2-day history chest wall pain associated with nausea, shortness
of breath, and worsened with movement.  In the ER at [**Doctor First Name 3093**], she
had a temperature of 100.4, BP 80s/40s, WBC 19K (87% PMN).  A
TTE
demonstrated LVEF 35%, small posterior pericardial effusion,
well-seated MV prosthesis.  Blood cultures demonstrated ([**2-4**])
demonstrated MSSA, a CT of chest w/ and without contrast
demonstrated a "tiny" fluid collection at the midline incision
site.  Wound cultures demonstrated WBC w/o organisms, although
at
time of transfer culture was pending. Empiric antibiotics with
vancomycin and ceftazidime ([**9-5**]) were continued.  During the
admission, she remained afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and
was
transferred for further evaluation.  She was taken to OR [**9-9**]
for
debridement and returned [**9-11**] for sternal plating.  Blood
cultures at [**Hospital1 22**] [**Date range (1) 28959**] remain negative at time of
discharge.  Although a swab culture from the wound on [**9-8**] was
negative, all 4 intra-operative swab and tissue cultures from
[**9-9**] demonstrated MSSA; no swab was taken on [**9-11**] (some necrotic
tissue was debrided).  A TEE was negative for endocarditis.
  For the remainder of the admission, she remained afebrile and
generally improved.  Two anterior chest drains remained intact
and in place at the time of discharge (to be removed approx 1
week post-discharge).  She had [**12-5**] loose stools daily for
several
days toward the end of the admission, briefly started
empirically
on metronidazole, but was C. diff toxin negative x1.
  She was continued on Nafcillin starting [**9-9**], and should be
continued for 6 weeks minimum starting [**9-11**].  In clinic
follow-up, duration of antibiotics will be determined, including
possible long-term suppression with ciprofloxacin and rifampin,
as well as a further discussion with surgery re: plate removal
if
indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for further management of her sternal
wound infection.  On [**2600-9-9**] she was brought to the operating
room where she underwent sternal debridement and wound VAC
placement with the assistance of the plastic surgery team.  The
patient returned to the operating room on [**9-11**] for chest closure
with pectoralis muscle flaps and plating.  Please see operative
notes for details.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedures
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU for
observation and recovery.  By POD 1 (from chest closure) she was
hemodynamically stable, extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.

ID was consulted for assistance in antibiotic administration.
Nafcillin therapy was initiated per ID recommendations.

The patient was transferred to the step down unit on [**2600-9-13**].
She developed diarrhea and was started on Flagyl empirically.
Two c-diff toxins were negative.  Imodium therapy was initiated.
A third c-diff toxin was sent. Her stool frequency decreased to
twice a day and began to firm. Only 2 doses of Imodium were
taken and Flagyl was stopped.

The patient remained in sinus rhythm,however, she continued to
have frequent PVCs with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Electrolytes were repleted and beta-blocker titrated
accordingly. Her ectopy improved dramatically with these
treatments.

Two JPs remain in place and she is afebrile.  ID and Plastic
Surgery continued to follow her and she was ready for discharge
on [**9-17**]. Arrangements were made for home infusion therapy for
Nafcillin and lab draws and follow-up with both infectious
disease and plastic surgery.

Medications, instructions and restrictions were discussed with
the patient before discharge.
