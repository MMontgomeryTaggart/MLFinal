TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  Altered mental status
   HPI:
   62M PMH CAD s/p CABG, DM2, HTN, CRF (baseline Cr 2.0), depression with
   past suicide attempt presenting with acute mental status change. The
   patient was unable to give a clear history due to altered mental
   status. Per his case manager [**Female First Name (un) 6731**] through [**Street Address(1) 6732**] Inn and
   his partner, [**Name (NI) 6733**] [**Name (NI) 6734**], he has been "sick" for the last two months,
   with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dermatologic
   lesions. He has been evaluated by his primary care physician over the
   past few months for these complaints and per report had an MRI abdomen
   at the VA that was unrevealing. Both his case manager and partner last
   saw him three days prior to admission and state that his mental status
   was at baseline at that time, AAOx3 and independent with IADLs.  His
   case manager saw him this morning and sent him to the ED for confusion.
   In the ED: 98.7 165/93 99 18 100% RA. His initial FS was 393. Blood
   cultures were sent. The patient was found to have a large erythematous
   hard collection on his left shoulder and multiple small pustules. An
   U/S of the back did not show a fluid collection. He was started
   empirically on Vancomycin 1 gm and Unasyn 3 gm IV. His K was 5.9 and
   patient was given Ca gluconate, 10U insulin & [**1-10**] amp of D50 and
   kayexalte. A urine tox was sent and the patient was transferred to the
   floor.
   On the floor: VS 100.5 158/114 114 18 98%RA.  The patient was found to
   be extremely lethargic and minimally responsive.  He was able to answer
   yes/no questions.  He was given 10U insulin.  Initial
   VBG:7.36/27/40/16, ABG:7.51/18/101/15.  CXR was performed.  Foley was
   placed and drained 1.7L.
   On arrival to the unit, the patient was initially minimally responsive,
   however, he was subsequently responsive to voice and answering yes/no
   questions, however,  oriented only x 1.

   Assessment and Plan
   62M PMH CAD s/p CABG, DM2, HTN, CRF (baseline Cr 2.0), depression with
   past suicide attempt presenting with altered mental status.
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear etiology and broad differential.
   Low-grade temperature and leukocytosis suggest infection, although
   stress response is also possible.  Most likely etiology of infection
   would be intra-abdominal process versus cellulitis
 chest x-ray,
   urinalysis negative.  Unlikely to be meningitis.  Medication overdose
   also likely, intentional or unintentional
 tox screens positive for
   tricyclics, otherwise unrevealing.  Uremia and metabolic derangements
   contributing.  Patient is hyperglycemic but there is no indication of
   ketoacidosis or HONK.  Calcium, liver function tests normal.
   - Continue vancomycin and start zosyn for now for empiric coverage of
   skin and abdominal pathogens
   - CT head and torso without contrast
   - Toxicology curbside
 monitor EKG for QRS widening which would
   suggest tricyclic overdose
   - Hold all sedating medications
   - NPO for now
   - Continue to monitor
   - Consider HIV test when patient able to consent
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine is 2.0 and 4.0 on
   admission.  A Foley was placed and patient drained 1.7L.  Could
   represent post-obstructive physiology given history of BPH.  Urine
   electrolytes not indicative of a prerenal etiology.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Urine eosinophils pending
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Continue to trend
   - Consider renal consult in the morning if no improvement
   # Acid base status: Patient has primary respiratory alkalosis with
   non-gap metabolic acidosis of unclear etiology.  Consider CNS lesion or
   medications for respiratory alkalosis
 unlikely hepatic failure or
   sepsis.  Most likely etiology of metabolic acidosis is early renal
   disease versus ingestion versus intra-abdominal process; no history of
   diarrhea.
   - D5 with 3 amps bicarbonate x 1 L
   - CT head and torso without contrast
   - Monitor closely
   # Left shoulder lesion:  Unclear etiology
 per patient
s partner,
   there is no history of trauma and the lesion has been progressively
   worsening over weeks.  He also has a number of smaller lesions on his
   left arm that may represent excoriations.
   - Consider dermatology consult for further evaluation
   - Wound care
   # Elevated lipase: Normal amylase.  [**Month (only) 56**] be elevated in the setting of
   acute renal failure.  The patient does not clinically have
   pancreatitis.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Type 2 diabetes: Currently not controlled.
   - Insulin gtt overnight
   #Hyperkalemia: In the setting of ARF.  No EKG changes.
   - Patient received kayexalate in the ED
   - Monitor
   # Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology
 likely due to nutritional deficiency
   since low albumin as well.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Consider vitamin K PO if mental status improves
   # Coronary artery disease: Status post CABG in [**3420**].  No ischemic
   changes on EKG.
   - Will give metoprolol IV overnight
   - Consider rectal aspirin in the morning if mental status not improved
   - Unclear regimen; will clarify regimen with home pharmacy in the
   morning
   # Hypertension: Currently hypertensive.  Unclear home regimen.
   - Metoprolol 10 mg IV Q6H
   - Will clarify regimen with home pharmacy in the morning
   # Depression: Unclear home regimen.
   - Would hold all medications in the setting of altered mental status,
   but will clarify regimen with home pharmacy in the morning
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO; consider NG tube if mental status continues altered
