   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Assessment: Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 6876**] is a 43 year old female with a history of
   hypertension, hypercolesterolemia, depression, and recent admission for
   acute cholecystitis who presents with acute right upper quadrant pain
   with ultrasound findings consistent with acute cholecystitis.
   Acute Cholecystitis:  Patient with right upper quadrant pain,
   leukocytosis and ultrasound findings consistent with acute
   cholecystitis.  She is not febrile.  Liver function test currently
   within normal limits.  Currently on vancomycin and zosyn given
   hypotension in the emergency room and concern for septic physiology.
   Plan at present is to treat conservatively with antibiotics and
   continue with plans for outpatient surgery on [**2577-1-27**].
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for now but can consider changing
   antibiotic coverage if improvement with blood pressures
   - appreciate surgical team recommendations, no plan for surgery now
   - NPO except for medications
   - LR boluses for UOP < 50 cc/hr or MAP < 65
   - peripherals for access currently
   - zofran for nausea
   - tylenol and oxycodone for pain control . AVOID MORPHINE PLEASE
   Hypotension:  Occurred in the setting of receiving 12 mg IV morphine in
   the emergency room.  Concern given likely gallbladder infection that
   this may also represent septic physiology although no fevers, lactate
   normal, leukocytosis resolved and no evidence of end organ ischemia.
   She has now received a total of 3 liters of normal saline.
   - lactate ringer boluses for UOP < 50 cc/hr or MAP < 65
   - antibiotics as above
   - cautious use of narcotic pain medications
   Hypoxia:  Patient with transient hypoxia overnight to mid 80s while
   sleeping.  Likely multifactorial secondary to hypoventilation, volume
   overload in the setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation and possibly
   a component of pneumonia although this seems less likely.  Exam with
   crackles at bases bilaterally. Echcoardiogram from [**2575**] with preserved
   ejection fraction.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - will continue IVF for hypotensin in the monitored ICU  setting
   - Portable CXR now
   - consider ABG to calculate A-ADO2 gradient if no improvement
   Hypertension:  As above, patient was hypotensive in the emergency room.
   - holding home antihypertensives for now
   Hypercholesterolemia:
   - continue simvastatin 20 mg daily
   Depression:
   - continue fluoxetine 20 mg daily
   - continue clonazepam 1 mg TID
   Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Patient reports diarrhea predominance over
   the past few weeks.  Has been taking loperimide frequently.  Given
   recent antibiotic use concern for antibiotic associated diarrhea vs.
   clostridium difficile.
   - stool for c. diff
   - hold antimotility agents until stool cultures negative
   - continue dicyclomine 20 mg TID
   - continue metoclopramide 10 mg TID
   - continue ompeprazole 40 mg IV daily
   Anemia: Normocytic to macrocytic.  Hematocrit has ranged form 30-35
   since [**Month (only) 569**].  Currently 30.3 down from 34.9 on presentation, likely
   dilutional. Guaiac negative in the emergency room.
   - trend hematocrit
   - active type and screen
   - check B12, folate
   -Hold ASA
   FEN: NPO, LR IVF boluses for MAP < 65 or UOP < 50 cc/hr, standing
   fluids for now, monitor electrolytes
   Access: 2 18 g IVs
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin
