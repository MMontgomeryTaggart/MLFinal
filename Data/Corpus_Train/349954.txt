   Assessment and Plan: 84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis
   who presents from [**Hospital 838**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia,
   transfered to CCU with acutely worsened hypoxia.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - continue Vanc/Levo for now
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   .
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints if chest pain and no
   iscemic changes on EKG.
   .
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.
   - will repeat TTE in am
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - continue beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   - will discontinue Amlodipine and start Verapamil to decrease ionotropy
   and improve diastolic filling
   .
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, and is supratherapeutic at 4.2, so
   will hold.
   .
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.
   - cont metoprolol and change amlodipine to Verapamil as per above.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, currently
   1.9 after aggressive diuresis.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - f/u urine lytes for Fe Urea
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.  Steroids were increased during
   this admission to 60mg PO qday.
   - Prednisone taper with 40mg PO qday starting tomorrow
   - Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - cont simvastatin 10mg daily
   .  .
   #. FEN:
         Thin liquids and pureed solids
      A. PO intake reclined in chair/bed ~45-60 degrees as able.
      B. Effortful swallow with small bites of food x 2.
      C. [**1-6**] follow-up sips of thin liquid to clear pharyngeal
         residue.
      D. Alternate bites and sips.
      E. Cough after follow-up swallows to clear any penetration.
      F. NO Talking until follow-up swallows/sips have been used
         after each bite.
   .
   #. Access: PIV
   .
   #. PPx:
   - DVT: systemic anticoagulation
   - Bowel: Senna and Colace
   .
   #. Code: Full per patient and HCP
   .
   #. Dispo: CCU for now
