TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  Shortness of breath
   HPI: 91M PMH CHF EF 35-40% with multiple recent admissions for
   exacerbations, CAD, CRF (baseline creatinine 3.8-4), DM2, admitted from
   [**Hospital 11**] Rehab after admission to OSH with GIB, presenting with SOB the
   morning of admission.  The patient's O2 sat was noted to be 92% on 2L
   NC, then dropped to the 80s.
   Of note, the patient was recently admitted to OSH with GI bleed.  ASA
   was discontinued, and his dose of lasix was decreased from 60 mg PO BID
   to 20 mg PO daily.
   In the ED, VS 99.8 91-103 104/55 30 90% NRB->100%BiPAP.  Exam was
   significant for bilateral crackles; stool is guaiac negative and is
   brown.  CXR showing bilateral pulm congestion.  Sign-out was that the
   patient received lasix 60 mg IV x1, however, there is no record of this
   medication being administered.  Urine output 50cc in the ED.  BP
   dropped transiently to 83/60 and returned to the 90s with 300cc NS.
   Bedside TTE was negative for pericardial tamponade or effusion.
   EKG showed lateral ST depressions and the patient was given ASA 325 mg
   suppository.  Foley placed with cloudy urine.

   Assessment and Plan
   91M PMH CHF EF 35-40% with multiple recent admissions for
   exacerbations, CAD, CRF (baseline creatinine 3.8-4), DM2, admitted with
   shortness of breath and likely CHF exacerbation.
   # Shortness of breath: Most likely etiology is CHF exacerbation.
   likely precipitant is recent decrease of lasix from 60 mg PO BID to 20
   mg PO daily with contribution of urinary tract infection.  Unlikely due
   to acute coronary syndrome.  Dry weight is 149 pounds prior to recent
   admissions per family.  No history of fever or cough to suggest
   pneumonia.  Greater than 100 pack-year smoking history but no diagnosis
   of COPD.  Patient low-risk for pulmonary embolus.
   - Check BNP, ROMI
   - Lasix 80 mg IV now, goal -1L
   - Standing combivent nebs Q6H
   - Morphine, nitrates PRN
   - Low Na diet
   - Daily weight
   - Continue carvedilol given hypertension, consider holding for acute
   exacerbation
   - Hold thoracentesis for effusion given risks and DNI status
   # Brief episode of hypotension: Unclear - not well documented.
   Hypertensive on admission to MICU.  Patient has UTI but well-appearing
   at this time and unlikely sepsis.
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Ceftriaxone for UTI
   - Urine, blood cultures pending
   - Monitor
   # Urinary tract infection: No indwelling Foley or history of resistant
   organisms in our system or per family.  Recently on ciprofloxacin.
   - Ceftriaxone pending urine culture
   - Urine, blood cultures pending
   # Coronary artery disease: Lateral ST depressions on EKG.  Chest-pain
   free.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Telemetry, ROMI
   - Restart ASA
   - Continue BB, statin
   # Chronic renal failure: Below baseline of 3.8-4, however, patient in
   and out of hospitals and likely lost muscle mass.
   - Renally dose all medications
   - Continue calcitriol, calcium acetate
   - Monitor
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive on admission.
   - Continue carvedilol
   # Type 2 diabetes: Complicated by neuropathy, nephropathy.
   - HISS
   - Hold glipizide
   - Continue neurontin, decrease for renal dosing
   # Anemia: Recent OSH admission for duodenal bleed; here brown, guaiac
   positive stool.  Unclear baseline hematocrit after recent bleeding but
   low- to mid-30s from last admission here in [**Month (only) 1002**].
   - Continue omeprazole
   - Monitor
