   Assessment and Plan
   GI Bleed -
   Hemetemesis with Hct 18. Getting transfused now. Vit K 10mg daily x 3
   days. GI to see today for endoscopy. CVC for access. Follow Hct q6hrs.
   Holding anti-hypertensives. Octreotide. Ddx gastritis vs ulcer vs (less
   likely) variceal bleed.
   + IV PPI.
   Acidosis -
   Lactic acidosis. Trending. Some oxygen delivery deficit with HCt 18,
   but also in the setting of liver disease.
   Etoh wd
   on CIWA scale now.
   Further plans as per resident note
   Can likely transfer out of the unit post-EGD.
