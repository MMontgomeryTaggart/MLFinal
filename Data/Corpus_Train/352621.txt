Chief Complaint:  respiratory distress

   Pulmonologist: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5092**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1962**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

   HPI:
   For complete details, please refer to initial medicine admission note
   and MICU call out note [**2668-11-30**]. In brief, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 5051**] is a 73 yo
   female with PMH significant for ILD on [**1-11**].5L home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital on [**11-23**] after a mechanical fall for
   pain control. On [**11-24**] patient had an aspiration event and hypoxia. The
   following day, she had evidence of aspiration on CXR and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  At that time, goals of care were discussed with
   her HCP, her husband, as well as her daughter and they felt they would
   want intubation.  She was made DNR as it was felt that CPR would not be
   indicated. She was transferred to the MICU.
   .
   In the MICU, she was intubated on [**11-25**] for worsening hypercarbia. That
   evening she spiked a fever, went into AF vs MAT with HRs into the 160s,
   and hypotension to the 80s. She did not tolerate beta blockers at that
   time and was started on an amiodarone gtt.  She was also started on
   empiric vancomycin and zosyn for possible aspiration pna.  She received
   aggressive volume resuscitation and converted to NSR the following
   morning.  Her amiodarone was discontinued given concern for worsening
   lung and liver disease.  Her beta blocker was uptitrated. Antibiotics
   were briefly discontinued on [**11-27**] and restarted on [**11-28**].  She was
   eventually diuresed and was able to be extubated on [**11-29**]. She was
   called out to the medical floor on [**11-30**].
   .
   While on the medical floor, she was continued on vancomycin and zosyn
   for presumed aspiration pna. She had no microbiology data to help guide
   therapy. She was continued on diuretics but has run I/O even per
   documentation. While on floor, SBPOs 100s, HRs 80s, RR 20s, O2 90s on
   3LNC.
   .
   On the evening of transfer, trigger called for increased work of
   breathing. Upon floor evaluation, patient denied any subjective SOB. O2
   requirement the same at 90s n 3LNC and no significant change in RR.
   However, at ~ MN, patient went into irregular SVT (AF vs MAT) to 150s,
   T100.3,  with SBPs into 90s, RR increased to 30s, and O2 sats low 90s
   on 4-6L. She received lopressor 5 mg IV x 2 without significant change
   in her HR and decrease in SBP to 80s. CXR repeated without significant
   change compared to this am. ABG showed 7.35/73/54.

   Imaging: CXR [**12-4**]:
   low lung volumes. No obvious pulmonary edema or infiltrate compared to
   am.
   Spirometry [**2668-10-29**]:
   FEV1: 0.87(42%), FVC:0.97(33%), FEV1/FVC: 90(128%)
   .
   ECHO [**2668-9-29**]:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
   free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2668-8-15**], no change.
   ECG: ECG [**12-4**]: MAT vs sinus tach w/ frequent PACs. Nl axis and
   intervals. Early RW progression. Nondiagnostic QWs inferiorly. NSSTTW
   changes. Compared to prior, no sig change.
   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   # respiratory distress: hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   Patient tenuous at baseline. Acute decompensation seems to have
   occurred in the setting of SVT w/ RVR. No dramatic changes on CXR.
   Difficult to interpret pulmonary exam given baseline rales d/t IPF.
   Must also consider worsening pulmonary infection although already on
   broad spectrum antibiotics. Was intubated so could be set up for ASBL
   bacteria and other resistent organisms.

   the past
   .
   # SVT: appears to be AF vs MAT on tele and ECG. Had similar episode on
   last MICU admission which did not tolerate beta blockers and required
   amio gtt. Again, associated with hypotension and may be contributing to
   respiratory distress. unclear inciting event. ? fever. At risk given
   underlying lung disease

   must also consider sepsis. Currently on broad spectrum abx.

   pain, diarrhea.
   - panculture: blood, urine, sputum
   - broaden antibiotic coverage as above

   Attending: history reviewed. Patient was seen and examined with Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **]. Mrs [**Known patient lastname 5051**] is followed by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 7067**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] in the pulmonary
   clinic.  DM, HTN, hypothyroidism, ILD without diffuse
   fibrosis/honeycombing, s/p liver transplant, s/p myeloprolif disorder
   s/p CHOP and Rituximab now with acute respiratory failure,
   pressor-dependent hypotension, and SVT.
   Admitted [**11-23**] with resp failure, intubated in MICU [**2581-11-24**], treated
   with Abx (no steroids), transferred to floor on [**11-30**]. Triggered today
   for low grade fever 100.3,  tachycardia to 150s, hypoxia on pO2 53 on 6
   liters O2. BP dropped following lopressor, transferred to MICU, put on
   BiPAP and amiodarone 150 mg IV given.
   Currently, MAP>60 on neo, HR 120 MAT vs. Afib, tolerating BiPAP 10/5,
   100% O2. 7.35/67/385. Unclear what precipitated tachycardia today-
   fever/infection vs volume changes unlikely vs. PE possible but on
   prophylaxis. On Vanco/Zosyn, agree with broadening coverage with cipro.
   Hypotension likely due to SVT and beta blocker, doubt sepsis. Follow up
   cultures.
   Other issues as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note. Code status: okay for intubation,
   no CPR. Husband is HCP.
   [**Name (NI) 51**] is critically ill and will remain in ICU. 35 minutes critical
   care time spent.
