Chief Complaint:  Hypercarbic acute on chronic respiratory failure
   Transferred for management of GIB
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   82 year old woman with a complicated medical history including CAD s/p
   CABG, AVR, Afib, COPE (3 L/min home O2, FEV less than 1.0) transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] Hosptial after complicated hospital course. Admitted on
   [**2840-1-9**] after she was found unresponsive in a shelter (temporarily
   there due to power outage in her home).  Bradycardic with HR-20's,
   hypotensive.  At [**Location (un) **] she had an emergent TV pacing wire placed,
   nodal agents were held,  intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure,
   labs notable for digoxin level ~3 for which she received digibind.
   She was empirically treated for COPD exacerbation/PNA with
   zosyn/azithromycin, solumedrol.  Course also notable for ARF felt
   secondary to ATN in setting of hypotension.  Cr had improved from 2.6
   to 1.7 prior to transfer.  Had received lasix for oliguria.  Hct on
   presentation was 19.4 (?baseline) for which she received 2 u pRBCs
   (unclear date of last transfusion).  She was extubated on HD #3.  Echo
   in hospital there showed preserved systolic function; pulmonary
   hypertension (PAP ~50).  Thrombocytopenia developed, zosyn stopped as
   felt to be the etiology, no heparin associated antibodies checked
   (unclear if she was receiving heparin).  She had a left sided
   thorocentesis which was transudative.  She continued to have loose
   stools, black guaiac positive requiring placement of rectal tube.
   Started empirically on IV flagyl and PO vanco for possible C. Diff,
   culture there negative x 1 for C. Diff.   Finally, course c/b heating
   pad related burn on back; stage II decubitous ulcer.  TV pacer was
   removed prior to transfer.
   Upon arrival to th eMICH she was in afib with RVR, experiencing chest
   tightness which she noted had been present since her extubation and was
   not new.  HR ~140, SBP ~160.  She received metoprolog 5 mg IV x 2 with
   better rate control; removed nitropaste prior to treating afib.

   Assessment and Plan
   1.  Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with known severe
   oxygen dependent COPD.  Treated empirically with solumedrol/abx course
   for acute COPD exacerbation (?tracheobronchitis/PNA). Left pleural
   effusion transudative, more consistent with CHF which may have been
   iatrogenic in setting of aggressive volume repletion when she presented
   with bradycardia/hypotension which has since resolved.  Now without
   productive cough, on 4 L/min NC (baseline home oxygen is 3 L/min).
   Continues in CHF.  Will continue solumedrol taper, bronchodilators,
   lasix diuresis, oxygen.
   2.  GIB:  Persistent dark guaiac positive stools.  Hct 26.0.  No
   documentation of NGT lavage.  Hemodynamically stable here.  Guaiac
   stools, serial CBC's, IV PPI, active type and screen, will transfuse
   for Hct < 25.  GI to consult.
   3. Acute renal failure in setting of hypotension, most likely ATN as
   felt by outside MD's.  Resolving with improved urine output and Cr.
   Monitor I/Os with foley, daily Cr.
   4.  Afib: Rate better controlled after metoprolol.  Restart metoprolol,
   diltiazem.  Hold on anticoagulation in setting of GIB.
   5.  Thrombocytopenia:  Felt to be secondary to zosyn, counts have
   improved after stopping this med.  Not clear if she had heparin, or
   antibodies checked.  Will hold on heparin products here for now and
   check for antibodies.  Follow counts.
   6.  CAD:  Has had chest tightness albeit notes this has been present
   since extubation.  No acute changes on ECG except flattened twaves in
   setting of RVR.  Will trend enzymes.  Cntinue simvastatin, beta blocker
   as above.
