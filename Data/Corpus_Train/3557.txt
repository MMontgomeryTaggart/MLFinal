Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1487**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p left heart catheterization for exertional angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3143-1-14**]
Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary
artery graft to left anterior descending, reverse saphenous vein
graft to the marginal branch of the right coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
64 year old primarily Portuguese speaking woman with diet
controlled diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia has been
experiencing symptoms of angina over the last several months.
Pain is substernal chest discomfort and occurs with exertion and
resolves with rest. She has no pain at rest. Of note, pt
presented to [**Hospital **] hosp ER recently with
nausea/vomiting/headache and was referred for stress testing,
which was done on [**3142-11-24**]. She experienced chest pain during
exercise and EKG was positive for 1-2 mm of upsloping ST segment
depression in V3-V6 and in inferior leads. Nuclear imaging was
normal. She was recommended to get cardiac catheterization after
positive stress result, and she is s/p diagnostic cath today via
right radial access initially, then right groin with 2 puncture
wounds, which "demonstrated left main and 2 vessel coronary
artery disease. The LMCA had an 80% ostial stenosis. The LAD had
a 60% lesion in the mid-aspect of the vessel. The LCx had minor
luminal irregularities. The RCA was notable for a proximal 70%
stenosis that was long, as well as a 50% mid lesion." She was
then admitted for for CABG and cardiac surgery is following. She
has been placed on a heparin gtt but has not been given plavix.

.
She denies prior history of cardiac disease. She denies
shortness of breath while lying on her back and shortness of
breath in general. She sleeps on three pillows at night [**1-7**]
reflux. No nausea, vomiting, headache. No change in BM or blood
in stool. No swelling in hands or feet. Admits to leg cramping
in her right leg.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was lying comfortably on her
back. She denies CP, admits only to pain in right wrist and in
her back, which is chronic. Vitals on arrival to floor are 98.4,
138/65, 60, 16, 99% RA.

IMAGING:
C. CATH [**3143-1-12**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated left main and 2 vessel coronary
artery disease.  The LMCA had an 80% ostial stenosis.  The LAD
had a 60% lesion in the mid-aspect of the vessel.  The LCx had
minor luminal irregularities.  The RCA was notable for a
proximal 70% stenosis that was long, as well as a 50% mid
lesion. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
systolic arterial pressures, with a central aortic pressure of
138/66, mean 97 mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left main and two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systemic systolic arterial normotension.
3. Evaluation for coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

CAROTID DUPLEX:Minimal bilateral ICA calcific plaque, no
appreciable associated stenosis, however, (graded as less than
40% bilaterally).

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**3143-1-18**] 3:59 PM

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has developed mild bilateral pleural effusions, better visible
than on the previous radiograph and better seen on the lateral
than on the frontal image. The size of the cardiac silhouette is
unchanged. There are mild areas of basal atelectasis but no
evidence of acute changes. The right central venous access line
has been removed in the interval.

Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic [**Hospital1 5169**].
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB:
The patient is on no inotropes and is AV-Paced.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old female with HTN, HLD, and DM found to have two
vessel disease with left main on cardiac catheterization and
referred to cardiac surgery for evascularization.
After preop workup patient was brought to the operating room for
Coronary bypass grafting with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3143-1-14**]. Please see
the operative report for details, in summary she had:
Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary
artery graft to left anterior descending, reverse saphenous vein
graft to the marginal branch of the right coronary artery. her
bypass time was 61 minutes with a crossclamp time of 48 minutes.
She tolerated the operation well and post-operatively was
transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. In
the immediate post-op period she remained hemodynamically
stable, woke neurologically [**Date Range 5168**] and was extubated. She
remained stable throughout the operative night and on POD1 she
was started on Bblockers and diuretics. Additionally she was
transferred to the stepdown floor for continued post-operative
management. All tubes lines and drains were removed per cardiac
surgery protocol.
Once on the floor she worked with nursing and physical therapy
to increase her strength and mobility. The remainder of her
hospital course was uneventful. On POD4 she was cleared for
discharge home with visiting nurses. She is to follow up with Dr
