Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Markedly
dilated ascending aorta. Markedly dilated aortic arch.
Moderately dilated descending aorta

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Moderate
(2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. No TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Results were
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

1. No atrial septal defect or PFO is seen by 2D or color Doppler
although difficult to find IAS due to rotation of the heart from
the aortic aneurysm.

2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).


3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4. The ascending aorta is markedly dilated The aortic arch is
markedly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is moderately
dilated.

5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.

7. There is no pericardial effusion.

8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results during the
surgery on [**2922-5-27**] at 1005.

POSTBYPASS

1. Patient is on nitroglycerin infusions

2. LV EF appears underfilled initially. After blood products the
LV EF looks similar to prebypass

3. A tissue valve is noted in the aortic position. It is well
seated and well functioning. No perivalvular leaks noted. Peak
gradient of 6 mmHg and mean gradient 2 mmHg.

4. Graft material is noted in the ascending aorta and tube graft
is seen in the descending aorta
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 5453**] was brought to the operating room on [**2922-5-27**] and
underwent a thoracic aortic aneurysm repair.  This procedure was
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical
intensive care unit.  She was extubated and weaned from her
pressors by the following day.  Her chest tubes were removed.
She was transferred to the surgical step down floor.  Beta
blockade was increased as tolerated and she was gently diuresed.
Ace inhibitor was started for optimal control of blood pressure.
 The patient made excellent progress with physical therapy.  By
the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  She was discharged home with VNA and appropriate
follow up instructions.
