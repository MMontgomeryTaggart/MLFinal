Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  30%  >= 55%
Aorta - Ascending:  *3.5 cm  <= 3.4 cm

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Prebypass

1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex, apical and mid
portions of the anterior wall, anterior septum, septum and
inferior septum. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %).

3. Right ventricular function is mildly depressed..

4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**3468-11-18**] at 1645pm.

9. Unable to obtain transgastric views.

Post Bypass

1. Patient is being AV paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine, epinephrine and milrinone.

2. LV systolic function is slightly improved. LVEF =40%

3. Aorta intact post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24662**] was brought emergently to the operating room on
[**11-18**] where he underwent CABG x 4.  Please see operative note
for details.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well
and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for observation and recovery.  By POD 1 the patient
was extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  He
was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no
inotropic or vasopressor support.  He was transferred to the
step down unit.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  He was diuresed toward his preoperative
weight.  The patient made excellent progress with physical
therapy, showing good strength and balance before discharge.  He
was discharged home on POD 4 with appropriate follow up
instructions.
