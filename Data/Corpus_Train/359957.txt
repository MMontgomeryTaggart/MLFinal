   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA OTHER
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   61 yo F with a history of possible asthma found to have a PEA arrest in
   outside [**Hospital1 17**].
   .
   # PEA arrest: The cause is unclear, given the normal cardiac
   catheterization, coronary artery disease is unlikely a cause.  However,
   acute pulmonary edema could have occurred given the elevated LVEDP/PCWP
   Other potential causes include hypoxia secondary to status asthmaticus,
   pulmonary embolism.  Thus will treat both currently.  Other potential
   causes include hypokalemia. Though only 3.5 on admission, this was with
   significant acidosis and thus total body potassium could be much lower
   than normal.  Hypothermia unlikely, cardiac tamponade ruled out from
   echo.  Acidosis present on initial gas, but could be secondary to
   hypoperfusion as a result of the arrest rather than the cause of it.
   Hypoglycemia cannot be ruled out as no glucose levels were measured
   prior to getting dextrose.
   Thus given the myriad of possibilities, will continue to gather
   information and treat empirically for acute asthma and PE.
   Additionally will get CT scan of Chest in AM, trend Cardiac
   output/index, follow and replete electrolytes
   - CT chest in AM
   - heparin gtt
   - Methylprednisolone/abx empirically
   - trend lytes
   .
   # Hypoxia/ Pulmonary: as above the patient has a history of asthma and
   was found to have significant improvement in 02 sats and airway
   pressures after albuterol.  Thus this may be secondary to acute severe
   asthma exacerbation.  Will treat for now with methylprednisolone at
   0.5mg/kg x 5 days.  As well, there may be multifocal pneumonia on CXR
   possibly due to aspiration in the setting of the arrest.  Nonetheless,
   will treat empirically with antibiotics for both aspiration and
   community acquired pneumonia.
   - Azithromycin/zosyn
   - heparin gtt
   - methylprednisolone
   .
   # CORONARIES:  no significant coronary artery disease
   .
   # PUMP:  significant cardiac dysfunction on echo with EF of 20%,
   elevated PCWP on cardiac catheterization.  Will continue with inotropic
   support and will continue to follow cardiac indices.  If the patient
   has clinical signs of hypoperfusion, will consider adding dopamine.
   Otherwise, will not give additional IVF for now.
   - repeat echo on Monday
   - follow PCWP
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Continues in sinus with LBBB
   .
   #  Leukocytosis: likely secondary to steroids and pneumonia in the
   setting of acute stress.  Will continue antibiotics, trend
   .
   # HCT drop: mild decrease.  Likely secondary to blood loss durin the
   procedure.  However, may also have RP bleed.  Will evaluate in AM with
   CT scan if continue to drop
   .
   FEN:  hypervolemic, lytes okay, NPO with NGT in plac
   ACCESS: PIV's, left fem line with PA catheter
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt, pantoprazole IV while intubated, on steroids
   and with NGT
   -Pain managment  and sedation with fentanyl/versed gtt
   -Bowel regimen
