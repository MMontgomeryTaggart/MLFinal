   in 90s, given two 500ml boluses, HR improved to 110s, SBP 100s
   -only 100ml urine output over 6 hours, orderded 500ml bolus to help
   with UO and to prevent drop in SBP with lopressor; later given two more

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   62 yo F with STEMI and schizophrenia who refused revascularization.
   .
   # STEMI: The patient has ST elevation with significant troponin
   elevation.  Given that the patient is unable to be revascularized, the
   patient will be managed medically.    The patient will continue to be
   able to refuse revascularization while stable.  However, should the
   patient become unstable, she will have to get a cardiac
   catherization.   The cardiology fellow has been in contact with the
   psychatrist on call who recommends that legal be contact[**Name (NI) **] in the event
   of necessitating a cardiac catherization.
   - Heparin gtt, integrilin gtt
   - Aspirin, plavix
   - serial cardiac enzymes
   - echocardiography on monday
   - beta blocker with goal HR <100, atorvastatin
   - serial ECG, continuous evaluation for arrhythmia
   .
   # PUMP:  Significant lower extremity edema, no signs of fluid overload
   on CXR or lung exam. However, previous history of intermittent lower
   extremity edema with associated weight gain and dyspnea is concerning
   for CHF.
   - strict I/O, lasix prn
   - echo in AM
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Not currently on
   anticoagulation.  Will start on Aspirin 325 mg for stroke ppx.
   Additionally will rate control with IV lopressor.
   .
   #  Cellulitis: Likely secondary to stasis with injury.  Will treat with
   abx, trend erythema.
   .
   #  Pneumonia: CXR consistent with LLL pneumonia, will treat with
   levofloxacin for now, will broaden coverage as needed
   .
   #  Schizophrenia- will continue home prescribed risperadal, normal
   .
   FEN: IV fluids normal,  normal electrolytes,
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   CODE: Presumed full
   DISPO: Cardiology floor service for now
