 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 LEUKOCYTOSIS
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   88 yo woman with h/o CHF, severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 608**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] chordae transferred from
   cardiology floor to CCU for a milrinone trial after failed diuresis
   with lasix drip.
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure.
   The patient presented with signs and symptoms of congestive heart
   failure with shortness of breath, increased oxygen requirement,
   pulmonary edema, lower extremity edema, and elevated BNP.  She has a
   known history of mitral regurgitation, however her worsening dyspnea
   and CHF was found to be secondary to a ruptured chordae tendonae and
   flair mitral valve.  She did not tolerate diuresis with lasix boluses
   secondary to hypotension, and her diuresis with lasix gtt has been
   limited by oliguria and increased creatinine.  An inotrope would
   possibly increase cardiac output to the point of improving diuresis.
   The goal of diuresis in this patient will be palliation of her dyspnea
   before sending home.
   -start milrinone, 50mcg.kg bolus, followed by .375mcg/kg/min.
   -continue lasix gtt
   -continue metolazone
   -continue albuterol/ipratropium
   -continue hydralazine for afterload reduction
   -consider nitroprusside for afterload reduction
   -holding [**Last Name (un) **] secondary to acute renal failure.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: rapid increase in WBC with prominent bandemia, now
   decreasing, afebrile since admission. Also with intermittent diahrrea
   as per nursing. C-Diff negative x 2. Abdomen mildly distended and
   tender.  Supine films with non-specific bowel gas pattern.
   - continue flagyl
   - follow abdominal exam.
   .
   #. CAD: no known history of coronary disease. Troponin peaked at 0.04
   and CK in 70s.
   - Continue ASA 81MG.
   .
   #. Rhythm: Sinus, monitor telemetry.
   .
   #. Depression, anxiety.
