   Assessment and Plan
   80M with CAD (LAD and OM1 stents in [**2767**]), chr syst CHF (EF 45%), HTN,
   HL, DM2, CKD (baseline Cr 3.0), who was admitted to the CCU w cardiac
   tamponade.
   # Cardiac Tamponade:  Drain for [**12-2**] was 300 cc.  Since midnight there
   is no drainage.  The patient does not have clinical signs of tamponade
   though there is a loculated effusion behind left ventricle on echo.
   Will repeat echo prior to removal of the drain.  Plan for drainage in
   AM.  Pulsus is currently 8.
   Will continue to follow  likely from uremia, though awaiting
   cultures.   from pericardial effusion of unclear etiology, possible
   etiologies include infectious, neoplasm, myocarditis, hypothyroidism
   (but TSH normal on [**2773-1-22**]).  Will continue the drain until <100 cc/24
   hours with echo prior to removal of the drain. History of systolic
   heart failure with EF 45%.
   - await fluid studies including cytology
   - monitor pulsus
   - IVF bolus if hypotensive
   - pull drain if <100 cc/24 hours, likely tomorrow am
   - holding diuretics and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 167**] restart only if SBP >165, otherwise
   will hold until pericardial drain.
   # CORONARIES: non coronary chest pain, though the cause seems likely
   secondary to mechanical causes and pericarditis . Trop 0.05 with CK 53.
   No evidence of active ischemia. Currently pain-free.
   - continue ASA, statin
   # RHYTHM: sinus
   - telemetry
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Likely pre-renal [**2-19**] decreased
   cardiac output in the setting of acute tamponade. Cr 4.6 on admission,
   from 3.0 at baseline, now improving with dranage of pericardial
   effusion.
   - renal following
   - urine lytes
   - gentle IVF
   - renally dose meds
   - monitor renal labs
   - urine microalbulin check today
   Chest pain, likely secondary to drain, pericarditis, will treat with
   tylenol, oxycodone. If persists, the patient could get a one-time dose
   of colchicine.
   .
   # HTN: BP currently stable
   - hold amlodipine in the setting of recent tamponade
   # Diabetes: Patient maintains the irratic glucose levels with most over
   250 but with AM hypoglycemia.  This is likely secondary to lack of
   adequate meal coverage.  Thus will give standing premeal humalog with a
   decrease in the PM lantus to 40 U.  Will give 25 Units now to bridge to
   a QAM schedule.    Additionally will increase mealtime insulin and try
   to get a copy of the home scale.
   LE pain:  likely secondary to diabetic neuropathy.  Will give tylenol
   standing, will also give oxycodone prn.   Could consider starting
   cymbalta.
   # HL: - continue statin
