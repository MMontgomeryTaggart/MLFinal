   Assessment and Plan
   85M w chronic systolic CHF (EF 30%), atrial fibrillation w RVR, aortic
   stenosis ([**Location (un) **] 0.8-1.0 cm2), HTN, Burkitt's lymphoma, who presented with
   altered mental status and dehydration, was transferred to CCU with low
   urine output, rising lactate, recent afib with RVR.
   # AMS: Similar to AMS on last admission, likely from delirium secondary
   to pneumonia. Slowly improving.
   - continue to limit sedating medications, limit restraints, remove
   Foley when possible
   - continue levofloxacin
   # RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation - Somewhat rate controlled, but unable to
   increase further as at maximum dose of metoprolol.  Limited additional
   agents (digoxin contraindicated given renal failure, amiodarone
   contraindicated given liver failure, CCB contraindicated given low
   LVEF/severe AS).
   - will add diltiazem and downtitrate metoprolol 125mg PO QID for better
   rate control
   - hold warfarin per PCP for fall risk, will continue aspirin 325 mg
   daily
   .
   # PUMP: Chronic systolic heart failure, EF 30% on [**2883-12-21**]. Not
   significantly volume overloaded on exam.  Will continue to follow fluid
   status as patient is very preload dependent.
   - maintain euvolemia
   - monitor I/O closely
   - continue metoprolol
   .
   # VALVES: Aortic stenosis - the patient
s aortic valve area of approx
   0.9cm2.  [**Month (only) 56**] be worsened overall status secondary to natural history of
   worsening of AS.
   - anticipate valvuloplasty as not ideal AVR candidate; but only when
   pna resolves
   .
   # PNA: CXR ([**1-5**]) w ?RLL consolidation. Treated w Zosyn at first, given
   that pt is from nursing home. Transitioned to levofloxacin PO
   - levofloxacin PO day 2 of 7 day course through [**2884-1-14**]
   - f/u blood cx - NGTD
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Likely [**1-24**] prerenal etiology from
   hypovolemie due to diarrhea. Also, poor perfusion given severe heart
   disease. History of CKD with baseline creatinine in ~1.5. Creatinine
   2.2 on admission. S/p 2L of NS since admission. Pt now euvolemic. Mild
   improvement.
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   # ELEVATED LFTs:  Likely [**1-24**] poor perfusion (dehydration, aortic
   stenosis, ?cardiogenic shock). Trending down. Unrevealing hepatitis and
   autoimmune workup during last admission.
   - trend LFTs; if rising, would get ultrasound.
   .
   # Elevated INR: INR 2.6, up from 1.3 at discharge on [**2883-12-28**]. Also
   elevated during last admission even though patient was not on warfarin.
   Again, likely from transient liver failure and malnutrition. No sign of
   active bleeding. Downtrending.
   - trend coags
   .
   # RUE edema: will stop IV antibiotics.  Elevate right arm, only use if
   urgent.  Not candidate for anticoagulation, no u/s for now.
   - remove PICC today
   .
   # HTN: Currently BP is stable.
   - continue metoprolol
   .
   # OSA: Not candidate for theophylline as uncontrolled AF.
   - CPAP at night as outpatient
   .
   # FEN: Regular low-sodium cardiac diet
   .
   # Access: PICC (to be d/c
d on [**1-9**]), PIV
   .
   # PPx:
   -DVT ppx with SQ Heparin
   -Bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: FULL CODE  for now; ongoing discussion regarding changing code
   to DNR/DNI
   .
   # Dispo: CCU care for now
