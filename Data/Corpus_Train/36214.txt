PRE BYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the septal
walls and severe hypokinesis of the apex, mid to distal
anterior, inferior anterolateral and inferolateral walls. There
is sparing of the anterior, anterolateral, lateral base. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF`10%). The RV is mildly to moderately depressed with apical
hypokinesis. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
POST BYPASS
The patient is receiving IV dobutamine at 5 ucg/kg/min and
norepinephrine at 0.07 ucg/kg/min There is slight improvement of
the previously functioning basilar rim of mycocardium in the
setting of inotropes. LVEF~15%. There is slight improvement of
RV systolic function. There is a well seated, well functioning
bioprosthesis in the aortic position (#25 [**Company 55**] mosaic)
There is no AI visualized. The MR now appears to me mild (1+).
The remaining study is unchanged from prebypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly dilated LV
cavity. Severe global LV hypokinesis.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV
free wall hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. Mild to moderate
([**12-4**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with severe global hypokinesis (LVEF <20 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen (may be underestimated). The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
There is a small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Biventricular cavity
enlargement with severe global hypokinesis. At least
mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Normal functioning
bioprosthetic aortic valve.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2542**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transfered [**4-7**] from OSH with known AS and 3 vessel coronary
artery disease for surgical evaluation. Brought to the operating
room and underwent Aortic Valve Replacement (#25mm [**Company 55**]
Mosaic Ultraporcine) /Coronary artery bypass grafting (Left
internal mammary artery grafted to Left anterior descending
artery/Saphenous vein grafted to Obtuse Marginal/Posterior desc.
artery)with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-8**]. Cross clamp time = 139
minutes/Cardiopulmonary Bypass time =183 minutes. Please refer
to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report for further details. He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred to the CVICU in
stable condition on levophed, insulin, dobutamine and propofol
drips. He remained intubated while weaning off of vasoactive
infusions, and on POD#3 maintaining hemodynamic stability, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Mr.[**Known patient lastname **] became
increasingly confused after extubation and remained in ICU for
an additional 2 days with minimal narcotic coverage.All lines
and drains removed in a timely fashion. He began to clear
mentally and was transferred to the stepdown floor on POD6 for
further monitoring. The remainder of his postoperative course
was essentially uncomplicated. He was started on Amiodarone and
Anticoagulation with Coumadin for rate controlled Atrial
Fibrillation.  Once on the floor the patient's confusion
cleared, his physical activity was advanced with the assistance
of the nursing and physical therapy staff and on POD 12
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] cleared Mr [**Known patient lastname **] for discharge to rehabilitation at
[**Hospital3 5422**] Center in [**Location (un) 800**], NH. All follow up
appointments were advised. He will followup with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2
weeks
