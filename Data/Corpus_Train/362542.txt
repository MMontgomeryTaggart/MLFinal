 CHRONIC PAIN
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of CAD s/p CABG,
   HTN, DM2 who presents on transfer from OSH with NSTEMI. On the floor
   she developed new EKG changes and was sent urgently to cath for high
   risk intervention.  She is admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.
   .
   #. CAD - patient has an extensive CAD history with 3 vessel disease and
   previous CABG. Patient's troponin elevated at OSH but no acute ECG
   changes there. Went urgently to cath lab yesterday after episode of CP
   with EKG changes and found to have LM disease and occluded SVGs.  She
   was taken back to the cath lab for intervention and intra-aortic
   balloon pump was placed for LM protection.  Balloon was then removed
   and patient remained hemodynamically stable.  Underwent PCI to LM-LAD
   and LCx.  Currently CP free.  CK and MB flat here with trop rising
   0.36->0.43
   - heparin and eptifibatide gtt d/c'd
   - trend troponin until peaks, continue to trend
   - continue ASA, zocor, lopressor, imdur, plavix
   #. Pump - most recent echo from [**10/3287**] demonstrates EF 40%, 2+MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **]mid to distal inferior, inferoseptal and apical hypokinesis.  Has
   severe diastolic dysfunction on cath today.  JVP not elevated
   currently, however BNP [**Numeric Identifier 7566**] and has oxygen requirement with bibasilar
   crackles.
   - cont. to monitor fluid status carefully, particularly given post-cath
   hydration.
   - JVP flat on exam
   - daily weights
   - Cont. afterload reduction with hydralazine
   .
   #. Rhythm - Currently in NSR
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Possible pneumonia: Patient with possible RLL infiltrate at OSH,
   given 3 days of levaquin for CAP. Patient had low grade fever on
   admission here, cont. to have a cough.  CXR here shows b/l pleural
   effusions and no clear infiltrate.
   - follow fever curve
   - continue IV levaquin, currently day [**6-3**]
   - guaifenesin for cough. Given post-cath will also add tessalon perles
   prn to prevent cough
   .
   #. HTN:  Currently well-controlled.
   - continue lopressor, imdur, hydral, amlodipine with hold parameters
   .
   #. DM: diet controlled at home
   - monitor FS QID
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   #. Chronic renal insufficiency:  baseline Cr 1.8-2.0. Cr up slightly
   this am, however received high dose dye load x2 so at high risk of
   contrast nephropathy.  Low UOP
   - receiving mucomyst, had post cath hydration
   - renally dose meds
   - follow Cr
   - gentle rehydration, given exam/oxygenation not c/w with severe
   overload.  Low UOP.
   .
   #. Anemia of chronic disease - baseline Hct reported to be 30
   - continue iron supplementation
   - guiac stools
   - Cont. to follow closely given cath and recent anti-platelet agents
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Noted to be chronic issue for the patient. Na 129 on
   transfer here, currently Na 132.  Likely related to CHF if chronic and
   improved with diuresis,
   - Cont. to follow
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   .
   #. Gout
   - continue allopurinol
   .
   #. FEN: Follow and replete electrolytes. Cardiac/diabetic diet.
   .
   #. Access: PIV
   .
   #. PPx:  Bowel regimen, Calcium, Hep SC
   .
   #. Code: DNR/DNI reversed for procedure, patient expressed wish to be
   DNR/DNI
   .
   #. Dispo: ICU care for now, call out to floor if UOP improves out of
   trigger range
