Date of service: [**2551-12-28**]
   Requesting physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: (Other: Milrinone therapy)
   History of present illness: 33 yo male with a history of dilated
   cardiomyopathy (TTE [**8-7**]: EF 20%), h/o ventricular tachycardia s/p ICD,
   atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, h/o L PCA CVA, and hypothyroidism
   secondary to Amiodarone who presents for diuresis and milrinone
   infusion.  Patient was admitted for aggressive treatment by his
   outpatient Cardiologist.  Per the patient, he has been admitted to the
   hospital 3 times in the last month for CHF exacerbations.  First on
   [**11-30**] and again 8 days after discharge.  Most recently he was admitted
   4 days ago with worsening LE edema and abdominal distention.  He was
   admitted overnight for IV diuresis.  His edema improved and he was
   discharged home.  The patient's wife came to [**Hospital1 **] today to pick up
   medications for her husband and she conveyed to his Cardiologist that
   the patient has had multiple recent hospitalizations.  Given this, the
   decision was made for admission for more aggressive treatment and
   consideration of home milrinone therapy.
   .
   In the ED vitals were T 96.8 HR 90 BP 96/61 RR 16 100% RA.  CXR showed
   no significant change.  He was admitted to the CCU for milrinone gtt.
   Currently the patient feels well.  He denies CP or SOB.  He denies
   orthopnea.  He reports that his LE edema is improved.

   Skin: b/l venous stasis changes
   Tests
   ECG: (Date: [**2551-12-28**]), afib at 77, diffuse low voltage with no
   significant change compared with prior.
   Echocardiogram: (Date: [**8-8**]), The left atrium is moderately dilated.
   No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
   echocardiography). The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is
   severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
   is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending
   aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
   is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2551-1-1**], the
   findings are similar (left ventricular cavity size was similar on
   review of the prior study).
   Stress Testing: (Date: [**2547-9-25**]), (Protocol: ETT), INTERPRETATION: 29
   yo man h/o ideopathic dilated cardiomyopathy;
   LVEF ~20%) was referred to evaluate changes in exercise tolerance. The
   patient completed 16.5 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6707**] protocol. Exercise was
   stopped at the patient's request secondary to fatigue. No chest, back,
   neck or arm discomforts were reported. No significant ST segment
   changes were noted. The rhythm was sinus with no ectopy noted. The
   blood pressure response to exercise was flat. The heart rate response
   response to exercise was appropriate.
   Resting oxygen consumption (V02) and respiratory exchange ratio (R)
   were 3.7 ml/kg/min and 0.89, respectively. VO2peak was 24.9 ml/kg/min
   with an R of 1.28. This represents 56% of the patient's age-predicted
   VO2max (pred max 44.0 ml/kg/min). Ventilatory threshold by v-slope was
   calculated at 20.8 ml/kg/min.
   IMPRESSION: Limited to fair functional exercise tolerance for age. No
   anginal symptoms or ECG changes. No exercise-induced arrhythmias.
   Blunted blood pressure response to exercise.
   Cardiac Cath: (Date: [**2551-1-7**]),
    1.  Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
   revealed no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.  The
   LMCA, LAD, LCX and RCA had no angiographically apparent flow-limiting
   stenoses.
   2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures with RVEDP of 12 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 19 mm Hg at
   baseline.  There was moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension of 45/21
   mm Hg.  Systemic arterial blood pressure was normal at 103/65 mm Hg.
   Cardiac index was depressed at a baseline value of 1.7 l/min/m2. After
   milrinone bolus of 0.5 mcg/kg IV over 10 minutes, left sided filling
   pressure were unchanged with a PCWP mean of 19 mm Hg.  Pulmonary
   arterial pressure decreased to 40/18 mm Hg.  Pulmonary vascular
   resistance also decreased.  Cardiac index improved to 2.2 l/min/m2.
   There was no change in systemic arterial blood pressure.
   3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
   .
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Coronary arteries are normal.
   2. Low cardiac index with improvement after milrinone therapy.
   3. Mildly increased left sided filling pressures.
   Assessment and Plan
    Patient is a 32M with idiopathic dilatated CM (EF 20%), afib, CVA,
   SDH, and hypothyroidism who is admitted for diuresis and milrinone.
   .
   # PUMP: CHF/Dilated Cardiomyopathy: TTE [**8-8**] showed EF 20%, diagnosed
   after presenting with Class III CHF symptoms in [**10-2**], thought to be
   viral etiology, s/p AICD. His dry weight is 100 kg, currently below dry
   weight at 93kg. Had recent admission at OSH where he presented with LE
   swelling and received IV lasix.  Currently does not appear volume
   overloaded, JVP flat, lungs clear and only trace edema. Plan as
   outlined by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]:
   - Inc. BB to 200mg tid given arrythmogenic effects of milrinone
   - Milrinone bolus of 50mcg/kg, followed by infusion 0.25mcg/kg/min, can
   titrate up to 0.75mcg/kg/min.
   - Maintain SBP>80, MAP>40
   - continue digoxin
   - Holding torsemide for now, will consider lasix gtt for diuresis if BP
   remains stable on milrinone.
   - holding ace-i for now, can consider starting in am
   - SW consult for possible milrinone therapy at home
   .
   # RHYTHM: Chronic atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, diagnosed in the
   setting of hyperthyroidism. Coumadin held [**Date range (1) 2727**] s/p SDH.
   - holding coumadin given INR supratherapeutic, restart once INR<2.5
   - uptitrate metoprolol as above
   .
   # h/o Ventricular Tachycardia: first noted in [**10-2**], had non sustained
   30 second run seen on Holter [**9-3**], s/p syncope from VT in [**9-6**].
   - monitor on telemetry
   - ICD in place
   - maintain K >4, Mg >2
   .
   # NEURO: s/p CVA as well as SDH. On Keppra for sz prophylaxis.
   Admitted to OSH in [**9-7**] after seizure at home and he was started on
   Keppra. Has been seizure free.
   - Cont Keppra 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Thyroid dysfunction: Originally had hyperthyroidism, secondary to
   Amiodarone (d/ced [**3-6**]), s/p prednisone and methimazole-->
   hypothyroidism
   -continue synthroid
   .
   # CRI: Baseline Cr 1.7-1.8, currently as baseline.  Likely related to
   poor forward flow.
   - Cont to follow with diuresis
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline Hct in low 30s.  Iron studies c/w chronic disease.
   Currently Hct 36, no signs of bleeding
   -Cont. to follow
   .
   # Osteoporosis: continue Ca, Vitamin D
   .
   # FEN: low Na diet, follow and replete lytes
   .
   # Access: PIV x2, ? PICC for home milrinone
   .
   # PPx: Hep SC

   Cardiology Fellow Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.

   Medical Decision Making
   33 yo male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (TTE [**8-7**]: EF 20%),
   h/o ventricular tachycardia s/p ICD, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   h/o L PCA CVA, and hypothyroidism secondary to Amiodarone who presents
   for diuresis and milrinone infusion.
   Start infusion at 50 mcg/kg bolus and 0.250 mcg/min/kg continuous
   infusion, titrate to urine output.  If BP stable start lasix drip; if
   hypotensive start vasopressin coinfusion.  We will continue the
   infusion for 3 days for a inotrop-holiday.

   on:[**2551-12-29**] 07:47 ------
   We will plan to implement a 3 day milrinone course in an effort to
   interrupt the vicious cycle of repeated chf hospitalizations (4 in 4
   weeks); he will also receive beta blocker, lasix gtt, and afterload
   reduction as tolerated; he is not a candidate for cardiac
   transplantation or vad support due to his undocumented alien status
