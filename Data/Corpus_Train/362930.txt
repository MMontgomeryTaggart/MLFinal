   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known patient lastname 4110**] is a 21-y/o F w h/o SLE c/b nephritis, pleural and pericardial
   effusions, s/p recent 1-month-long admission at OSH for lupus flare,
   who now presented with new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures x3
   at home and was found to have multiterritorial strokes, pericardial
   effusion w tamponade physiology as well as intraabdominal bleed.
   Currently consulting: rheum, neuro, nephro, heme, urology, ob/gyn,
   vascular surgery; as well as general surgery (signed-off).
   # Myopericarditis with pericardial effusion: Dilated CMP w decreased
   LVEF 20-30%. Most likely lupus-induced myopericarditis. Pt has h/o of
   tamponade and had signs of early tamponade on TTE [**1-6**], not responding
   to IV fluids.  No CP
   - repeat echocardiogram to determine if pericardiocentesis or window is
   indicated
   - consider afterload reduction with low dose lisinopril, holding in
   setting of acute renal failure.
   - now on prednisone 50mg per day
   # SOB/systolic CHF- episodes for last two nights, appears to become
   fluid overloaded, crackles on exam and CXR. Improved with dilaudid and
   lasix.
   - monitor fluid status
   - lasix PRN, if no pulsus or sx of tamponade
   # SLE: Complicated by nephritis and pleural/pericardial effusions.
   Concerning for associated thromboembolic disease with brain infarcts.
   Rheum considering cyclophosphamide vs cell cept.  Will ask for OB/GYN
   for recs regarding egg preservation once decision is made.  Options
   include cryopreservation or GnRH agonists at time of cyclophosphamide
   administration.  anti-cardiolipin and antiphospholipid antibodies
   negative.
   - prednisone 50mg daily
   - considering cyclophosphamide vs. cytoxan, likely to start this week
   - monitor c3/c4 levels for flare- pending
   - will start atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, pending G6PD
   # Hemoperitoneum: Unclear etiology. Baseline anemia ? Hct ~30. Large
   intraabdominal hematoma on [**1-6**]/209 appears ?subacute (organized debris
   with peripheral rim on U/S). Hct drop from 27 to 23 on argatroban,
   which was temporarily discontinued. Hct increased to 27 after one unit
   of pRBC. Once bleed appeared non-acute, argatroban was restarted, but
   Hct then dropped again to 24; argatroban stopped. PF4 negative.
   - hct stable
   - active T+C
   - consider further studies to find source of bleeding if hct drops
   again
   - consider anticoagulation w heparin, if Hct stable
   # Thrombocytopenia: most likely associated with her lupus. PF4
   antibodies negative.  Now on IVIG, day 2 in an attempt to achieve
   sustained platelet elevation.  Had one unit transfused last night.
   -IVIG
 continue tx
   -keep plts >100
   # Seizure/Strokes: Likely [**1-16**] thromboembolic stroke in right
   parietal-temporal-occipital lobes as seen on MRI of brain, which is
   consistent with the clinical presentation (visual hallucinations). Also
   concern for lupus cerebritis. Much less liikely is meningitis given
   immunosuppression.
   - consider heparin gtt anticoagulation
   - f/u hypercoag panel
   - continue levetiracetam
   - lorazepam prn should seize
   - f/u EEG read
   - hold off on LP; until more stable
   .
   # Recent infections: Outside hospital cultures with Morganella growing
   from thoracentesis fluid from [**12-7**], citrobacter freundii blood culture
   from blood culture on [**12-8**], and bacteroides blood culture from [**12-17**].
   She was sent home on [**1-3**] and instructed to complete a course of cipro
   and flagyl through [**1-8**].  Her antibiotics were switched to pip-tazo,
   given that cipro can lower the seizure threshold. Abx stopped per ID on
   [**1-8**].
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u G6PD before starting abx ppx (dapsone)
   - f/u ID regarding PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1957**]
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Due to SLE, with renal biopsy showing grade
   [**3-19**] membranoproliferative and membanous nephropathy. Also,
   hydronephrosis (right) on imaging with no clear sign of obstruction,
   likely [**1-16**] intraabdominal bleed compressing the ureter.
   - continue phos binders
   - bicarb now TID
   - renally dose meds, follow Cre daily
   - appreciate renal recs (will likely need to be on cellcept at some
   point)
   .
   #Hydronephrosis: US showing stable/improving hydronephrosis, creatinine
   stable.
   -urology recs- pt refusing foley for now
   .
   # FEN: regular diet, replete lytes prn
   # ACCESS: PICC
   # PPX:  pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen, seizure precautions
   # Code: FULL
   # Dispo: ICU
