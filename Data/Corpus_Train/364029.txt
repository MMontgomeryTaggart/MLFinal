Chief Complaint:  cough, hypoxia
   HPI:
   79 y/o M of PMHx of Atrial Fib, Diastolic CHF, Hypertrophic CMP, CAD
   s/p stenting and hyperthyroidism who presented to the ED with 4 days of
   productive cough, shortness of breath, progressive DOE, low grade
   fevers/chills and decreased appetite.
   .
   In the ED, initial VS were: T 100.1 P 100 BP 155/106 RR 20 Sats 90% on
   RA. Initial EKG revealed rapid afib and HR trended up into 150-180s, pt
   was started on dilt gtt at 5mg/hr which acheived good rate control.
   Portable CXR showed pulmonary edema & possible RUL opacity.  Labs
   revealed a troponin of 0.06, CK 181, MB 3 and lactate of 2.8 that came
   down to 2.2 after 2L of NS IVF.  Pt received Aspirin 325mg, Ceftriaxone
   1gram & Levofloxacin 750mg for possible RUL infiltrate.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, pt was feeling better but still reporting cough,
   congestion and shortness of breath.  Pt also reported some new
   abdominal fullness, decreased appetite and subjective fever/chills.  He
   had possible sick contacts from a wake he attended last week.  He
   denied CP but reported orthopnea and progressive DOE.
   .

   Imaging: Echo [**3140-3-7**]: The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous
   echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium and left atrial
   appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
   (<0.2m/s). Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
   right atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the right
   atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
   seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is
   severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function
   is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular function is normal with normal
   free wall contractility. There are simple and complex (>4mm) atheroma
   (at 34 cm from the incisors) in the descending thoracic aorta. There
   are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly
   directed jet of mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is a small pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 y/o M with PMHx of CAD, Diastolic CHF, HOCM and Atrial Fib who
   presents with subjective fevers, cough, hypoxia and volume overload.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Etiology likely multifactorial including pulm edema [**2-24**]
   diastolic CHF, possible URI with bronchiolitis, possible infiltrate c/w
   PNA, ACS much less likely given absence of symptoms. Pt is clinically
   volume overloaded on exam with BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 3249**]. Exam also reveals diffuse
   wheezes and cough that may all be cardiac in origin.  However, pt
   describes URI symptoms, possible sick contacts and elevated lactate.
   - continue Levofloxacin 750mg for possible CAP
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - f/u am CXR, consider stopping Abx if no infiltrate
   - send sputum, rapid viral screen & f/u blood Cx
   - diuresis with lasix 40mg IV (goal neg 1-2L/day)
   - rate control with BB & valsartan for afterload reduction
   - trend lactate
   - place foley, strict i/os
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - CPAP overnight
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Pt presented with HR of 100 and
   developped rapid Afib in the ED. Pt was started on a Dilt gtt and rate
   came down to 100s.  Pt is currently CP free, denying palpitations and
   BP stable in 120/70s.
   - wean dilt gtt overnight
   - start Metoprolol 25mg QID, titrate up prn
   - hold coumadin given INR 3.6
   - f/u TSH/T4 given h/o hyperthyroid
   .
   # Diastolic CHF/HOCM: Pt with severe HOCM and diastolic CHF who
   developped rapid Afib with RVR in ED which likely decreased filling
   time further and worsened pulm edema.  Rate controlled in 100s on dilt
   gtt but would prefer to use betablocker for HOCM/diastolic CHF.
   - wean dilt gtt
   - start Metoprolol 25mg QID and titrate up prn
   - Valsartan 80mg daily (replace olmesartan while in house)
   - lasix 40mg IV now, goal neg 1-2L/day
   .
   # CAD/trop: Pt denying CP, CKs flat and EKGs without acute changes.  Pt
   noted to have Afib with RVR in ED.  Suspect that isolated elevation in
   troponin may be due to acute renal failure vs demand ischemia in
   setting of RVR and hypoxia
   - will continue to cycle CEs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue ASA, Toprol and Atorvastatin
   - f/u repeat EKG
   .
   # Hyperthyroid: continue home medications of tapazole 2.5mg daily
   .
   # Hypertension: stable
   - start metoprolol 25mg QID as above (wean dilt gtt)
   - replace Olmesartan 20mg with Valsartan 80mg daily while in house
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac heart healthy, low Na diet
   - replete electrolytes prn
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin 5000u sc TID, bowel regimen, PPI
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2

   # Code: DNR/DNI confirmed with patient

   # Communication: with patient & son
