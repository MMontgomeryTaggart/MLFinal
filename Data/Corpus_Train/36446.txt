Cardiac catheterization [**2863-5-25**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three
vessel disease. The LMCA had mild luminal irregularities but no
flow
limiting stenosis. The LAD had a mid subtotal occlusion after
the 1st
diagonal branch with collateral filling of the distal vessel.
The LCx
had an 80% proximal stenosis of OM1. The RCA had sequential 90%
mid
stenoses followed by a subtotal occlusion before the distal
bifurcation
of the PDA and PL. There was minimal flow into the PL branch.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial
hypertension with SBP 141mmHg and DBP 85mmHg.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute subtotal occlusion of the distal RCA.

Echo [**2863-5-26**]
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and extensive systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Mild aortic
regurgitation.Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2862-6-20**],
the left ventricular cavity is smaller with improved
inferolateral systolic function. The other findings are similar.


CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibotor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Based on [**2860**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
# STEMI:
In the ED, initial vitals were: HR 100 BP 126/72 RR 24 Sat 98%.
The patient was given plavix 600 mg, integrillin, and heparin.
She was taken to the cath lab where she was found to have TIMI 1
flow in a large rPL branch and serial lesion in the RCA. She was
given three overlapping bare metal stents. She developed a
moderate hematoma during case which was compressed and remained
stable, but for this reason she was not continued on
integrellin. She was chest pain free at the end of case but with
residual ST elevations.  She then developed mild chest
discomfort and was tachycardic.  She was given IV lopresser 2.5
mg and the chest discomfort resolved.  Her echo showed EF 30%
and extensive systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel
CAD or other diffuse process but with improved inferrolateral
systolic function compared with prior.  She will need to
continue the aspirin 81 mg (lower dose given GI bleed below),
plavix 75 mg for at least one month, atorvastatin 80 mg,
metoprolol, and lisinopril.  She will need to follow up with her
cardiologist and Primary Care, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9398**] on Friday [**6-1**].

.
# GI bleed: After her catheterization the patient had 300 cc of
melenotic stool. NG lavage was performed and revealed evidence
of old coffee ground blood. GI was consulted who decided that
she should be supported medically given her recent
procedure/STEMI. (Of note, the patient was recently admitted to
[**Location (un) **] in [**2863-1-2**] where she had a GI bleed and refused
endoscopy at that time) RBCs were requested, but due to
antibodies, the pt had to request blood products from the Red
cross.  The patient was found to be hypotensive to the low
80s/high 70s and was bolused with LR until she received 3 units
of RBCs.  She was started on a protonix drip and had no evidence
of further bloody stools.  Her Hct remained stable and her
lactate was not elevated.  It was thought that her bleed was
likely from an upper source in the setting of receiving heparin,
integrillin, plavix, and aspirin.  She was initially made NPO,
but her diet was advanced slowly and she tolerated this well.
Her beta blocker, ACEi, and lasix were initially held and
restarted before discharge. H pylori is currently pending. She
has an appt with outpt gastroenterologist at [**Location (un) **] and was
encouraged to keep the appt.
.
# Groin Hematoma: The patient developed a large right hematoma
as a complication from her catheterization. No bruits were
auscultated.  She was not continued on integrellin post cath for
this reason.  The hematoma remained stable and should improve
over time.
.
# Back pain: The patient has chronic back pain at baseline.  To
treat her pain she was given morphine 1 - 2 mg Q 4 hr while she
was NPO.  She was also given tylenol 1 gm Q 6 hours and Lidoderm
patch which she said did not improve the pain. therefore, she
was sent home with no change to her pain regimen.
.
# Depression: noted by pt appearance and history. Gerontology
consult called and recommended 15 mg Remeron qhs to treat
depression, help her sleep and possibly improve her appetite.
This medicine should be uptitrated to effect by PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 32910**] agree with plan and pt encouraged to make her
wishes clear about further medical therapy. A social work
consult was asked for on page 1 to help her with end of life
decision making.
.
# Urinary urgency: pt stated she felt like she had UTI on day of
discharge, long history of these after foley catheterization.
U/A mostly bland and cx pending. Given symptoms, pt was sent
home on 3 day course of ciprofloxacin.

Right groin hematoma
Depression

Secondary diagnosis:
low back pain
systolic CHF


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital because you were having shortness of
breath and were found to be having a heart attack.  You were
emergently taken to the cath lab where you received three bare
metal stents to your blocked artery.  You had some leaking of
blood from your blood vessel in your groin after the procedure.
You also developed bleeding from your rectum and this was
thought to be from bleeding up near your stomach.  You were
given red blood cells and IV fluids and the bleeding stopped.

Please note the following changes to your medications:
1. Continue Plavix every day to prevent the stent from clotting
off. Do not miss [**First Name (Titles) 1588**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1587**] or stop taking Plavix for one month
unless Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tells you to.
2. Decrease your aspirin to 81 mg daily
3. Start taking Calcium with Vitamin D to prevent bone loss
4. Start Pantoprazole twice daily to prevent further stomach
bleeding
5. Start Lidocaine patch to painful back area once daily
6. Start Mirtazipine 15 mg at night to help your mood and your
appetite. This will probably need to be increased by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 9398**].
8. Take senna up to twice daily to prevent constipation
9. Take Ciprofloxacin for 3 days to treat your urinary tract
infection
