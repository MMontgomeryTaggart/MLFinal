   Assessment and Plan
   72F w HTN, HL, COPD, originally p/w worsening SOB, was found to have
   3vCAD and elevated PCWP, now awaiting CABG.
   # Elevated INR: 1.7, repeat 1.6. Vitamin K given. Unclear etiology.
   - check LFTs
   - trend INR
   # CORONARIES: 3vCAD w occluded LAD, stenotic LM, proximal RCA and PDA,
   evaluated by CT Surgery for CABG.
   - IABP in place 1:1
   - heparin gtt
   - ASA 325 daily
   - metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   - atorvastatin 20 daily
   - awaiting CABG
   # PUMP:  Likely chronic systolic CHF. EF 40%, evidence systolic and
   severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction on ECHO/cath. Not
   decompensated. Pt relatively asymptomatic with markedly elevated PCWP
   (~43).  Optimized hemodynamics prior to surgery w diuresis.
   - PA catheter in place for tailored therapy
   - ACEi on hold pre-surgery
   - Vasodilation with NTG
   # RHYTHM:  NSR. Monitor on tele
   - continue metoprolol
   # COPD
   -Standing ipratropium inhaler
   -Prn albuterol inhaler
   -IS at bedside
   # HTN:
   -metoprolol
   -NTG gtt
   -hydral for afterload reduction
   -holding home verapamil for now
   -hold ACEI in setting of dye load, cr 1.3 and pre-CABG as above.
   # Hyperlipidemia. Pt carries dx of elevated lipids, on recent PCP labs,
   LDL low at 62, low HDL 33.  Has been on fibrate therapy for "years" for
   unclear reasons.  In setting of low HDL, and for peri-operative med
   optimization will start low dose statin.
   -Atorvastatin 20mg daily
   -repeat lipids
   # Depression - Continue home dose fluoxetine, 20mg TID confirmed with
   pt and pharmacy.
   FEN:NPO except meds/sips for now. NPO after MN for surgery. Otherwise
   low sodium diet, fluid restricted.
   ACCESS: PIV's, PA catheter
   PROPHYLAXIS:  bowel regimen, on hep gtt
