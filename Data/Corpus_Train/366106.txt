Chief Complaint:  hypotension/resp distress
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6451**] is an 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**10-14**]), s/p
   MCA CVA, afib, HTN, and DM II, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 52**] from
   [**Date range (1) 7885**] and [**Date range (1) 7886**] for HAP and UTI [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital **]
   hosp for hypotension.
   .
   History is unclear as obtained from scant OSH records and patient
   unable to give history. He appears to have been at NH when found to
   sats 81% RA, foley draining dark amber urine. He was noted to have
   severe peripheral edema and given levoquin X 1 and lasix 40 mg IV X 1
   at OSH. He became hypotensive to 80's at OSH, placed an EJ and started
   peripheral neo.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: T 100, P 81, BP 107/58, R 18, 100% NRB O2
   sat. Patient was given Vanc/Zosyn, tylenol, and 1L NS in ED. Bladder
   was changed in ED with UCx very positive and sent to ICU.
   .
   On the floor, he has no complaints. History is obtained mostly from son
   as patient only answers with single words.

   [**3205**] ECHO The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
   right atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function
   is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Mildly depressed LV systolic dysfunction. Thickened aortic
   valve leaflets without stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**10-14**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be pulm or urine. He has very psoitive
   U/A. Of note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in
   recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx
   - f/u blood, urine cx
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**3205**] 45%. On exam, lungs sound mostly clear, although he
   is total body volume overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - consider repeat echo
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart tomorrow
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic and chronic foley
   - treatment as above
   - foley changed in ED
   - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in urology
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**1-3**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**1-4**]
   - would stop Flagyl as c. diff toxin a and B negative on [**1-4**]
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - telemetry until ROMI with CE x 3
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.5 which is mostly likely prerenal azotemia
   - gentle IVFs overnight
   - check urine lytes to calc FEUrea
   .
   # Hypernatremia: I suspect hypernatremia is from excess free water loss
   from fever, insensible losses.
   - send urine lytes
   - gentle free water replacement (he has a 3.7L deficit)
   - D5W at 75 cc/hr
   .
   # Alkalosis: seen on ABG 7.47/39/211, suspect contraction alkalosis
   from insensible losses
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**1-8**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor
   - would care consult
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - Low sodium dysphagia diet with ensure pudding
   - Boost puddings 6 per day
   - Elevate scrotum and lower extremities to decrease anasarca
   - Aspiration precautions
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI
   .
