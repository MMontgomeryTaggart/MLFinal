   Assessment and Plan
   58 y/o F with morbid obesity s/p gastric bypass, pulm HTN (likely
   Phen/Fen), severe OSA on home BiPap (18/15), OHS, restrictive lung dis
   from obesity and airways dis from childhood asthma, came in with
   hypoxia and URI sx/cough.
   #. Hypoxia: O2 requirement ~10L compared to her home regimen of 2-4L.
   VBG shows her baseline chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic
   compensation, with a pCO2 at about 85.  CXR is unchanged with no focal
   abnormalities/new effusions.  Lung exam shows poor air  movement with
   diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, and dry early inspiratory
   crackles.  DDX includes acute asthma exacerbation vs pulmonary
   interstitial edema.  No clear evidence of left sided HF on prior echo,
   and XR difficult to interperet in the setting of diffuse airway
   diseases.
   -Will treat with bronchodilators: one hour of continuous albuterol
   nebs, then q2-4H standing, spacing as tolerated.  Will also treat with
   standing ipratropium q4H
   -High dose steroids, will taper when O2 requirement is back to baseline
   -Supplemental O2 prn to keep sats 89-92%, CPAP at night
   -Will Obtain an echocardiogram to assess for new LV dysfunction, will
   hold off on lasix given elevated creatinine until we have this study to
   support its use.
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Patients family reports she has been having
   difficulty managing at home (she lives alone).  They also report
   symptoms of somnolence and confusion, which is intermittent.  I suspect
   she is transiently hypercapnic during these episodes, as her baseline
   is quite high to begin with.  I am concerned that given her multiple
   pulmonary issues, she is failing to thrive at home, and that her
   underlying pulmonary issues are progressing.  She has had multiple
   recent hospitalizations for hypoxia (three in the last year)
   -Case management, PT, OT to evaluate possible [**Hospital3 **]?
   -Will involve her pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 587**] for optimization of her
   current pulmonary issues, incluiding an assessment of her current CPAP
   settings, chronic asthma management etc.
   .
   #. ARF: Creatinines have been elevated over the past month to 1.4-1.6,
   family is reporting poor PO intake, specifically with hydration.  Also
   some concern for poor forward flow state from ?LV dysfunction.
   -Will send urine lytes/sediment
   -Monitor UOP, bolus if not at goal of 0.5cc/kg/hr, otherwise will hold
   off as patient may have a component of LV dysfunction.
   -Echo to assess forward flow.
   .
   #. Chronic abdominal pain: Historically sounds consistent with muscle
   strain/abdominal wall pain.  Had been worked up on a previous admission
   and was thought to be secondary to muscle strain with a component of
   constipation.  Patient notes improvement with laxatives, and
   exacerbation only with coughing.
   -Continue laxatives, cough suppressants, and lidocaine patch
   .
   #. OSA: continue CPAP [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 167**] monitor its efficacy in house
   .
   #. Obesity Hypoventilation syndrome: CO2 retention at baseline
   .
   #. Obstructive lung dz:
   -will treat for an acute exacerbation
   -optimize her chronic management by increasing her inhaled steroid to 2
   puffs [**Hospital1 **] vs. a long-acting B2 agonist
   .
   #. Pulmonary HTN: continue home [**Last Name (LF) 8056**], [**First Name3 (LF) 167**] order an echo to
   assess for any changes in her underlying process.
   .
   #. HTN: BP stable
   .
   #. Heart failure: has a diagnosis of chronic right sided heart failure,
   with some mention of diastolic dysfunction.  Echo from [**3086**] shows EF
   65-70%, no LVH or mention of this.  Managed with torsemide.
   -Will hold on torsemide for now, given ?dehydration
   -repeat echo in AM

   #. Iron deficiency anemia: stable

   #. Osteoarthritis: stable
