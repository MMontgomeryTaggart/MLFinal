Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 107**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterisation

History of Present Illness:
55 y/o M with PMH of prostate cancer s/p XRT but no other
significant past medical history and no cardiac risk factors who
presents with an STEMI. Around 1:30 PM noted the sudden onset of
chest pain and presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where na ECG showed [**Street Address(2) **] elevations in leads I, aVL, V4-6. Got ASA, plavix lead, and
heparin, and was transfered emergently to the [**Hospital1 22**] cath lab
where angiography demonstrated a total occlusion of the very
distal LAD. LV gram showed a normal EF with apical AK. An
attempt was made to open the lesion with a wire as it was too
small for stention or balloon angioplasty, but this was not
effective. Given the small area at risk, a decision was made to
treat medically to avoid a potential procedural complication.
Post procedure the patient had some mild [**2994-12-20**] chest discomfort
that was similar to his presenting pain. In the setting of
hypertension to the 160s, the patient was started on a nitro
drip with improvement of his pain, although he continues to
complain of intermittent chest pain. The patient is admitted to
the CCU in stable condition.

In the CCU, he contiues to complain of intermettient [**2994-12-20**]
chest pain, no palpitations, dyspnea/ abdominal pain.  Has been
eating, drinking, urinating normally.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2996-12-25**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:

Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural surfaces. No
evidence of
pneumonia or CHF.
.
[**2996-12-26**] Echocardiogram
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
A patent foramen ovale is present with right to left shunting of
agitated saline contrast during Valsalva.
.
[**2996-12-26**] Lower Extremity doppler ultrasound
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in right or left lower
extremity.
.
[**2995-12-25**] Cardiac Catheterisation
Change for 6 French XB3 guide.  The initial plan was to pass the
wire as the primary reperfusion device.  A Pilot 50 Wire was
passed in a prolapsed fashion but this did not restore flow.
Given that the patient was pain free and the small territory at
risk, it was decided to avoid further attempts at recanalization
(with balloon angioplasty) given risk of dissection,
perforation.
The patient had intermittent chest pain at the end of the
procedure and was started on IV TNG and administered opiates
with
resolution of chest pain.  He left the laboratory in stable
condition.
.
[**2996-12-27**] Foot XRay
Three views show the bony structures and joint spaces to be
essentially within normal limits. No dorsal swelling or evidence
of erosion
is appreciated. No calcaneal spurs.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o M w/ PMH of prostate CA, HTN, presenting with distal
apical NSTEMI.
.
# APICAL LAD STEMI:  Distal LAD thrombosis with distal apical
infarct, s/p unsuccessful recanalisation during cardiac
catheterisation.  No other evidence of coronoary atherosclerosis
was found. Echocardiogram whowed preserved EF and no ventricular
wall motion abnormalities. However, he was noted to have a
patent formane ovale.  Given absence of atherosclerotic disease,
PFO and known CA prostate, thromboembolic event from a possible
proximal DVT remains a possible etiology for his STEMI.  Cardiac
enzymes peaked [**2996-12-25**] and trended down prior to discharge. He
was treated with a heparin drip for 2 days after the procedure,
as well as aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol.  He was started on
lisinopril and atorvastatin, but these were held in the setting
of acute kidney injury.  He will need to continue aspirin
lifelong and clopidogrel for at least one year given his
prothrombotic state.  Atorvastation was restarted at the time of
discharge.
.
# s/p CATH: unsuccessful attempt at wire recanalisation of
distal LAD.
.
# THROMBOEMBOLISM: Cardiac cath shows no evidence of coronary
atherosclerosis.  MI site is unusual and patient has PFO,
history of prostate cancer, prothrombotic state. LENIs were
negative, but did not include an evaluation of the iliac
arteries.  He will continue aspirin and plavix for
anticoagulation following discharge.
.
# Fever: Etiology unclear. UA, CXR clear.  Urine cultures and
blood cultures pending.  However, timing of fever suggests
possible link with gout flare.  Other etiologies include:
infection, post-MI, thromboembolism/PE, B-symptoms from cancer.
His fever curve trended down spontaneously prior to discharge.
.
# Thigh pain - bilateral. Could be from strenous workout pt
reports. CKs coming down but CK so out of proportion elevated
compared to MB. We just started statin which can cause myopathy
but states thigh pain since presentation. Pt without significant
CAD that we know of.  We held his statin, but restarted it at
the time of discharge.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr of 1.4 on [**2995-12-28**] up from baseline of 1.0.  Could be
secondary to high
CK. Uric acid was 6.6, urinalysis was clear.  We gave him a
small fluid bolus.
.
# Right ankle pain - Most likely gout flair. pt with history of
gout. A foot Xray was performed which showed no pathology.  His
pain was controlled with percocet and colchicine.
.
# HTN: BP was high on presentation and he was initially on a
nitro drip, but this was rapidly weaned and he was treated with
metoprolol instead.  He was also started on lisinopril, but this
was held given [**Last Name (un) **]. He will need reevaluation
.
# Cardiac Risk factors: patient has hypertension.
Lipid panel was unremarkable.  HbA1C was pending at the time of
discharge.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ACE inhibitor was held due to creatinine
elevation.
Please reassess hypertension and creatinine as an outpatient and
consider restarting an ACE inhibitor if indicated.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the [**Hospital1 2943**].  You were admitted with a heart
attack. We performed a cardiac catheterization which showed a
small blockage in the blood supply to the apex of your heart,
but no other abnormalities in the blood flow to your heart.  We
attempted to open this blockage, but were unable to do so and
did not attempy further since the reduction of heart function
was very small.  An echocardiogram was performed and this
confirmed that your heart was beating normally.  The
echocardiogram also showed that you have an open flap in your
heart forming an abnormal connection between the right and left
sides of your heart (a patent foramen ovale).  This kind of flap
is found in over 10% of people.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
-STARTED Aspirin
-STARTED Clopidogrel
-STARTED Metoprolol
-STARTED Atorvastatin
-STARTED Oxycodone and Colchicine for pain
-STOPPED your home benzapril
