   HPI:
   Pt is a 55 yo female w/ PMHx sig for AVR on coumadin, DM,HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia who is transferred from NWH for evaluation of
   SDH.  The patient has had n/l face/frontal sinus pain over the last two
   weeks.  She had multiple ENT evaluations that were found to be
   negative.  She had an outpatient CT  that showed a R frontal
   parietotemporal SDH extending from the vertex to the frontal pole and
   temporal tip with mild midline shift.  The maximal thickness is ~ 8
   mm.  INR was 4.8 two weeks ago, 1.5 on [**2-21**].9 yesterday, and 2.8
   today.  She was given 2 units of FFP at the OSH and sent to [**Hospital1 52**]
