   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o gentleman with history of diastolic CHF, hypertension who
   presents with acute CHF exacerbation requiring non-invasive
   ventilation. Now with new 3+MR concerning for mechanical etiology vs
   worsening volume overload
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE - He has known
   hypertension and diastolic dysfunction with normal E:A ratio, though
   this could suggest pseudonormalization. MR [**First Name (Titles) 4400**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4813**] to left
   sided failure. No evidence of ischemia by ECG or biomarkers.
   - Continue BiPAP as needed
   - Diuresis with IV lasix gtt
 goal 2L negative
   - Holding  BB and ACE-I in the setting of ongoing hypotension
   - ECHO showed Dilated left ventricle with normal global systolic
   function. Dilated and at least mildly hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild
   aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Severe
   pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
   of [**2780-1-24**], LV is more dilated. Mitral regurgitation severity has
   increased, and pulmonary pressure is more severe.
   .
   # MR: Concerning for ischemic MR vs volume overload.
   - Continue aggressive diuresis as above with lasix drip
   - Optimize medical management prior to evaluation for possible need for
   surgical intervention
   .
   # H/O DVT ON ANTICOAGULATION
   - Hold warfarin today for INR of 4.8
   .
   # MYELOMA
   - IgG numbers had been recently normal, dexamethasone held as
   outpatient secondary to fluid overload
   # CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE
   - Would benefit from ACE inhibition
 currently limited by BP
   # HEMATURIA
   - Outpatient urology w/u necessary. Will monitor for clots.
   # BPH
   - Continue finasteride.
   # SLEEP APNEA
   - BIPAP as needed overnight.
   # FEN
   - Lyte repletions, [**Hospital1 **] Check.
   # CODE DNR/DNI , confirmed with patient and daughter
