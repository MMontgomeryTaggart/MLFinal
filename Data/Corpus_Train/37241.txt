Chief Complaint:
complete heart block

Transesophageal echocardiography
Left sided permanent pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 54 yo M with bicuspid aortic valve presents with
pre-syncope and found to be in complete heart block.  The
patient was in his normal state of health until 2 days PTA when
he felt fatigued and weak.  Today he had 2 episodes of
pre-syncope and a few seconds of syncope today while walking his
dog.  He felt like he was going to fall and had to go to his
knees.  He took 2 full dose ASA at home and presented to [**Location (un) **]
and was found to be in complete heart block with 5-7s pauses.
He was given 2g calcium transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] for further
management.

In the ED: 98.6 93 181/101 18 100%RA.  His ECG showed complete
heart block with 3-4s pauses. A RIJ was placed and as well as a
temporary pacer. CXR showed no PTX and was pacing at 50's.

On the floor the patient is doing well. He denied any CP,
palpitations, light-headedness, dizziness, SOB or other
symptoms.  The patient reports that 6 months prior he noticed a
tick on his skin after walking his dog. He did not have a rash
or fevers associated with the bite.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

STUDIES:
[**2674-1-11**] EKG
Sinus rhythm with paroxysmal complete heart block. Right
bundle-branch block. No previous tracing available for
comparison

[**2674-1-11**] EKG
Baseline artifact is present. Sinus rhythm with paroxysmal
complete heart
block and demand ventricular pacing. Right bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing demand ventricular pacing is
new

[**2674-1-11**] CXR
No acute cardiopulmonary process

[**2674-1-12**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is bicuspid
with mildly thickened leaflets that display systolic doming.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.1cm2). An
eccentric jet of mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Bicuspid aortic valve with thickened leaflets and
moderate aortic stenosis/mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. No
discrete vegetation seen (does not exclude). Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define
the aortic valve for possible vegetations

[**2674-1-12**] TEE
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve is bicuspid with moderately
thickened leaflets that display systolic doming. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Significant aortic
stenosis is present (not quantified). Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen directed towards the anterior
mitral leaflet.. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Bicuspid aortic valve with thickened leaflets but
without discrete vegetation. Mild-to-moderate aortic
regurgitation. Significant aortic stenosis.

[**2674-1-12**] EKG
Sinus rhythm. Paroxysmal complete heart block. Right
bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing pacing is no longer evident

DISCHARGE LABS:


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 54 yo M with bicuspid aortic valve presents with
pre-syncope and found to be in complete heart block.

1. RHYTHM: Pt was found to be in complete heart block with 3-7s
pauses. Acute onset and unclear cause. Patient no history of
ischemia or MI. Possible AS with calcification leading to
conduction disorder, lyme, abscess are other possibilities.  The
patient was started empirically on doxycycline for treatment of
lymes carditis but this was discontinued prior to discharge,
when lymes titer returned negative.  A temp wire was
successfully placed and intracardiac electrocardiogram showed
infranodal block. The patient had TTE and TEE, which showed
bicuspid aortic valve with thickened leaflets but without
discrete vegetation, mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, and
significant aortic stenosis. The patient had persistent paced VT
overnight on [**1-12**] - the pacing wire was adjusted, and the
patient had no further episodes of VT. A permanent pacemaker was
placed on his left side on [**2674-1-13**]. He was given a dose of Vanc
after the procedure, and will need to take Clindamycin for 2
days.  he will follow up in the device clinic for wound check in
1 week and with EP in approximately 6 weeks.

2. CORONARIES: No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes negative
x2. Pt was started on ASA 325mg PO daily.  Recommeded to take
ASA 81 mg daily for primary prevention based on cardiac risk
factors following discharge.

3. Bicuspid AS: Pt reports he has bicuspid AS. + murmur on exam.
No CHF or CP. Syncopal episode most likely from complete heart
block rather then AS. TTE and TEE both noted AS with mild to
moderate AR.  Will likely need to have AVR in future.  Of note,
the patient should receive prophylaxis for endocarditis prior to
any invasive procedures.

4. PUMP: Euvolemic on exam. EF 60-65% on ECHO.

5. Leukocytosis: WBC 11.7 on admission, afebrile and no
localizing symptoms; likely acute stress response. CXR with no
consolidation. No bandemia on diff. Pt remained afebrile during
hospitalization.


Medications on Admission:
None

Discharge Medications:
1. Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every
6 hours) as needed for pain.
2. Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet
PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain.
Disp:*28 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*
3. Clindamycin HCl 150 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO Q6H
(every 6 hours) for 2 days.
Disp:*12 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*
4. Aspirin 81 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known patient lastname **],

You were admitted to the hospital with feelings of fainting. You
were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm. You had a temporary
pacing wire placed until you were able to have a permanent
pacemaker placed in your chest.

The following changes were made to your medications:
1. Take Clindamycin every 6 hours for 2 days
2. Take Percocet every 6 hours as needed for pain.  Please do
not drink or drive with this medication as it can make you
drowsy.
3. Take a baby aspirin daily to help prevent against future
cardiovascular events

Please keep the left side of your chest dry for 7 days.
Limit your arm movement at the left shoulder joint. No heavy
lifting for the next 6 weeks.

Please call your physician or go to the emeergency room if you
develop shortness of breath, dizziness/ faintness, chest
discomfort, fever, redness at the site of your pacemaker or any
other concerning symptom.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your electrophysiologist/cardiologist to
ensure that your new pacemaker is working properly and to check
your wound:
