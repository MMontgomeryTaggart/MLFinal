infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2789-10-6**] 1. Excision of right femoral to anterior tibial bypass
    graft with complete removal of foreign material.

with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 581**] who presented to [**Hospital3 **] today with
pus from bypass site and found to be in DKA. She initially
presented because she thought she was having dark stools and was
concerned for a GIB which she's had in the past.  She was found
to have dark pus coming from her fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass site.  At OSH,
her right leg was noted to be red from the surgical site down to
her knee.

1:8.  Urine and blood cx drawn. No CXR done.  UA was negative
except for ketones and glucose.  She was given 2L IVF, 5u iv
insulin and placed on insulin gtt at 10u hr.  Repeat sugar was
348. EKG had non-specific ST changes, but none was available for
comparison.  No cardiac enzymes were drawn.  Her right leg was
noted to be red with drainage from surgical site.  She was
treated with Unasyn 3g and vancomygin 1g iv.
.
On arrival to the ICU patient reports that she noticed drainage
from the bypass incision site 1-2 days ago.  She denies fever or
chills.  She endorses nausea though no vomiting. She denies
diarrhea.

Studies:

[**2789-10-2**]: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats. ST-T wave
abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2789-7-6**] the atrial
premature beats are new. ST-T wave abnormalities may be more
marked.

[**2789-10-2**]: CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, today's
image shows
multiple respiratory motion artifacts and is limited in
interpretability. The lung volumes are normal. There is no
evidence of pleural effusions. The sternal wires have been
removed in the interval, however, several clips projecting over
the mediastinum are still visible. No evidence of pathological
parenchymal opacities, no pulmonary edema. No focal parenchymal
opacity suggesting pneumonia. The size of the cardiac silhouette
is at the upper range of normal.

unremarkable. Status post CABG. Clips in the left paratracheal
region.

IMPRESSION:

Discharge Instructions:
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING TRANSMETATARSAL AMPUTATION

This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a
speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these
guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you
otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any
questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.

ACTIVITY:
There are restrictions on activity. On the side of your BKA you
can not bear weight. You should keep this amputation site
elevated when ever possible

No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.

PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).
New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.

Exercise: You should work with PT and OT daily. Limit strenuous
activity for 6 weeks. Do not drive a car unless cleared by your
Surgeon. No heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds for the next 30
days.

.Try to keep leg elevated when able.

.BATHING/SHOWERING:
You may shower in a shower chair. No baths or soaking. You may
wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will have
sutures/staples which are usually removed in 4 weeks. This will
be done by the Surgeon on your follow-up appointment.

WOUND CARE:
Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for
four weeks after surgery.

MEDICATIONS: Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all
of the medications you were taking before surgery. You will be
given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken
every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.

.

Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you
should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check
with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel
that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may
use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite
suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small
balanced meals throughout the day.

CAUTIONS:
NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is
an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of
your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you
smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse
or doctor for information on smoking cessation.

.

Avoid pressure to your amputation site.

No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery.

.

DIET:

.You should follow a diabetic diet. Poor appetite is expected
for several weeks and small, frequent meals may be preferred.

.
For people with vascular problems we would recommend a
cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and
low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile
in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in
serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a
reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that
most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to
decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the
bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density
Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's
permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred
or get a referral from your doctor.

.
If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight
management program. Your health and its improvement depend on
it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be
easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new
attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get
a referral from your doctor.

.

If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may
request a referral from your doctor.

FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:

.

Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your
improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the
chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood
pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to
the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated!

.

Please call the office on the first working day after your
discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This
should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days
after discharge. Normal office hours are 8:30-5:30 Monday
through Friday.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR
QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT
