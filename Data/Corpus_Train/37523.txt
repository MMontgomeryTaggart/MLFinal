History of Present Illness:
68 year old female with  known Coronary Artery disease and
carotid artery disease was admitted to [**Hospital6 35090**] on [**2917-11-2**] with chest discomfort and jaw pain.
She reports discomfort presented during exertion and was not
relieved by rest. Sublingual nitroglycerin helped with resolving
the pain. She had several episodes the following day. She noted
dyspnea and radiation to the jaw. She denies nausea, vomiting or
diaphoresis. The pain again progressed the day of admission when
she presented to the emergency department. Her EKG showed NSR
with anterolateral ST segement depression more accentuated than
baseline EKG per OSH reports. She was admitted for further
treatment. While she was in the hospital she ruled in for NSTEMI
with a troponin peak of 5.1. She was catheterized which showed
severe 2 vessel disease LVEF reportedly normal. She had post
cath chest pain which resolved with NTG and morphine. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] for evaluation and cardiac surgery was
consulted for coronary artery revascularization.

ECHO [**2917-11-5**]:
Off-Pump CABG:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 68-year-old patient, who presented with unstable angina
with non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction, subsequently had a coronary angiogram
which showed 2-vessel disease involving the left anterior
descending artery and a small obtuse marginal artery. Initial
angiogram showed the obtuse marginal to be quite small so the
plan was to possibly stent this artery and do endoscopic LIMA to
LAD graft. Subsequent angiogram the next day, when she developed
further pain, showed the OM to be bigger than initially thought
of and hence she was taken to the OR for an off pump sternotomy
and 2-vessel bypass grafting on [**2917-11-5**]. Preoperative CT scan
showed severe calcification of the ascending arch and descending
aorta and hence the plan was to proceed with off-pump coronary
artery bypass grafting.  See operative note for details.
The patient was hemodynamically stable on transfer to the CVICU.
 She was weaned off neosynephrine with stable cardiac
index/output.  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 35091**] [**Last Name (Titles) 66**] neurologically intact and  was
extubated on post operative day 1 morning without incidence.
Postoperatively she transiently had an episode of atrial
fibrillation, was treated with amiodarone and converted to sinus
rhythm. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac
surgery protocol.  She was transferred to the step down unit in
stable condition.  Physical therapy continued to work with her
to increase strength and endurance.  On post operative day #4,
she did have a large amount of loose stools.  She was negative
for Clostridium difficile and her bowel regimen was adjusted
with resolution of her diarrhea.  She remained afebrile, in
sinus rhythm and her incisions were healing well.  It was felt
that she was safe for transfer to rehab on post operative day #
6. All follow up appointments were advised.
