   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is an 88 year old man with significant
   cardiac history who is admitted with significant coagulopathy, acute
   renal failure and a GI bleed.
   .
   # GIB: Patient had 13 point HCt drop over last week with
   lightheadedness and orthostasis.  No blood pressure drops or evidence
   of hemodynamic instability in the ED.  He did have guaiac positive
   brown stool, but no evidence of melena or BRBPR according to the
   patient.  INR greater than assay, though no clear precipitating
   symptoms.
   - Hold ASA/warfarin
   - Maintain access with 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T&C
   - 1 units prbcs now, will transfuse to goal of 30 given CAD and
   question of ischemic ECG changes with elevated trop, though this is
   most likely in the setting of ARF
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - NPO for now
   - Q4H Hct
   - Correct coagulopathy as below
   - GI fellow aware, no plan to scope at this time given coagulopathy, no
   indication for NGT given risk for trauma-related bleeding. EGD / [**Last Name (un) **]
   when stable
   - Bleeding scan if acute bleed
   .
   # Coagulopathy: No clear etiology for acute rise. Patient has INR
   checked monthly.  No recent illness, change in warfarin dosing or
   dietary changes.  Patient rec'd 5 mg of Vit K in ED as well as 2 units
   FFP, now INR down to 6.6.
   - Will give another dose of FFP now given knee hematoma and GI bleed
   - Additional FFP for any necessary procedures
   - Holding asa/coumadin
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # L knee hematoma: Occurred after traumatic fall in the ED.  Patient
   did have a prior knee surgery on that side, will need to clarify what
   type of surgery.
   - Follow CK
   - Will get plain films to assess for fracture or other underlying
   abnormality
   - Will ask ortho if there is any indication for further investigation
   .
   # ARF: Baseline creatinine around 1.1, now up to 2.6 over the last
   week.  Likely in the setting of hypoperfusion from GI bleed (also with
   large Hct drop as above). Initial UA relatlively non-diagnostic, some
   hyaline casts present.
   - Will send urine lytes
   - Urine eos
   - Avoid nephrotoxins including ACEi/lasix for now
   - Renally dose all meds
   - UA with reflex override to look for sediment / casts
   .
   # CAD: No current complaints.  Was feeling lightheaded in the setting
   of GI bleed.  Also with small trop bump to 0.03 and ?TWI that resolved
   in the ED.
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat ECG in am
   - Continue statin, hold metoprolol, felodipine, lisinopril as above,
   and aspirin
   .
   # Aortic aneurysm s/p repair: No current treatment
   .
   # BPH: Continue finasteride and terazosin with holding parameters
   .
   # DM type 2, insulin dependent: Continue home 70/30 with HISS, half
   dose 70/30 while NPO
   .
   # HTN: BP have been stable. In the setting of GIB, will hold
   metoprolol, CCB, lasix, and ACEi as above.  Restart when GIB resolved
   or BP becomes elevated
   .
   # FEN: Prbcs and FFP as above, IVF as needed, replete electrolytes prn,
   NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Supratherapeutic INR at this time, continue to monitor,
   IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] for GI bleed, bowel regimen prn
   .
   # Access: peripherals, large bore
