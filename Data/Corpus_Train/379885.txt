Chief Complaint:  Dizzy
   HPI:
   60M with PMH of CAD s/p 3 vessel CABG, IDDM and anemia who presents
   with one day of dizziness.  The patient states that he woke up at 4am
   to go to the bathroom this morning and felt dizzy.  He returned to bed
   and was persistenly dizzy with all subsequent attempts to get out of
   bed.  Patient notes that he had a dark bowel movement this morning.
   He also vomited once this orning.  This afternoon, he came to
   dermatology clinic for scheduled biopsy of an umbilic nodule.  On
   [**2691-4-7**], the patient had had a CT scan of his abdomen that revealed a
   4.5cm pancreatic mass with mesenteric and umbilical nodules concerning
   for metastases.  Following the derm appointment, the patient came to
   the ED for further evaluation.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.6 P 106 BP 94/61 R 18 O2 100% RA
   Patient did not take his insulin this am and had a blood glucose of 707
   in the ED for which he received 10 units of insulin.  Repeat FSBS was
   489.  The patient was also noted to have a positive troponin of .27 and
   an index of 9.1.  Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and it was thought to be due
   to demand in the setting of a hematocrit of 20.  Cardiology recommended
   giving the patient and aspiring, which was done.  In addition, the
   patient received 2L NS.  CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
   EKG showed T wave inversions in inferior leads, ST elevation in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   depression in V5 and V6.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, vitals 98.5 102 101/55 12 95% on 2L.  Pt had no
   complaints.  ROS as below.  Pt received additional 10 units of insulin
   for persistently elevated blood glucose.

   Imaging: CT Abd - [**2691-4-7**] - 1. 4.5-cm spiculated mass centered in the
   distal pancreas, highly concerning for malignancy. Mesenteric nodule
   and umbilical nodules are compatible with metastatic foci.
   2. Splenomegaly.
   3. Cholelithiasis, no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
   4. Limited assessment of solid organs due to lack of IV contrast.

   Chart reviewed, patient examined, case discussed in detail with Dr.
   [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].   I agree with her note above.  In addition, I would
   add/emphasize:
   60M w/ PMHx sig for known CAD (s/p CABG and recent + stress test),
   recently dx presumed metastatic pancreatic cancer, s/p bx of umbilical
   node.  Referred post bx to ED, found to have hct 20, EKG changes ST
   elev inf leads, ST depressions V5, V6, I, avL with Trop bump 0.27 to
   1.17.
   Demand ischemia
   Cardiology consulted, recommend aspirin, beta blocker if tolerated.
   Transfusing pRBC to goal hct 30 given demand ischemia.  Ischemia likely
   demand mediated and not related to plaque rupture.  Best treatment
   improve oxygen carrying capacity through pRBC.
   CHF
   Follow fluid status closely given h/o CHF
 latest EF 35%.   If sats
   dropping with pRBC, lasix between units.
   Hyponatremia
   Likely pseudohyponatremia due to elevated glucose.  No intervention at
   this time
   Hyperglycemia
   FSG 700s, spilling glucose in urine, no ketones, gap already closed.
   Glucose falling already down to 300s.   sliding scale is fine though if
   jumps back up, insulin drip.  Let [**Last Name (un) 257**] doc know pt is in house.
   Presumed metastatic pancreatic cancer
   s/p umbilical node bx. Mult nodules throughout mesentery.
