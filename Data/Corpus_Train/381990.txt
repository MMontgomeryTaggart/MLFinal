   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo man with history of biventricular failure, CAD, CABG in [**2466**],
   admitted for evalution of likely CHF exacerbation.
   #  CHF exacerbation:  Biventricular failure, NYHA Stage 4.
   - Switched to oral torsemide given aggressive diuresis accomplished.
   - Patient did not tolerate milrinone, switched back to dopamine for
   pressure control, but attempting to wean
   - Continue digoxin
   - Restarted carvedilol, midodrine and aminophylline yesterday,
   aminophylline at increased dose of 100mg QD, can titrate up to [**Hospital1 **].
   - Unclear if the patient has been taking losartan at home, however will
   not start [**Last Name (un) 281**] in the setting of hypotension.
   - Palliative care consulted
   # Atrial Flutter:  The patient has been in atrial fibrillation
   regardless of attempts at chemical cardioversion with amiodarone in the
   past.  It appears on 12 lead from admission that the patient is in
   atrial flutter at a rate of 150bpm.  If the patient remains stable and
   improves clinically, may consider cardioversion at the end of this week
   or beginning of next.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - continue to hold coumadin for suprathrapeutic INR
   - Restarted carvedilol as above
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - Continue simvastatin, aggrenox
   - carvedilol as above
   # History of TIAs:
   - Continue aggrenox
   # BPH:
   - Continue flomax, with holding parameters
   - condom cath
   # Cataracts:
   - Continue opthalmic treatments including predfort, acular, zymar, and
   cosopt.
   # Gout:
   - Continue colchicine
   # Hypothyroidism:  The patient's daughter reports that they did not
   initiate levothyroxine therapy given unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] results.
   - TSH showed elevation, however Free T4 also elevated, unclear etiology
   likely subclinical hypothyroidism
