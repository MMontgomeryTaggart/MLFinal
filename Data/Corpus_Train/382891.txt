   24 Hour Events:
   She was restarted on CVVH during the afternoon after being off for 8
   hours
   TPN was d/c'd as she was at goal on her tube feedings
   Started long acting insulin, glargine 15 units SQ (was on [**Hospital1 **] glargine
   as outpatient)
   temp up to 100.8, blood cultures sent
   Around midnight she went into SVT at 150bpm Aflutter/fib and dropped
   her pressure to systolic 80's in the setting of CVVH at 200 ml/hr.  She
   was given IVF bolus of 1.5L total with no improvement.  SBP's further
   dropped to the 70's systolic, she was briefly started on levophed while
   preparing to cardiovert and she was cardioverted with 150 Joules x1
   with conversion to NSR.  Levophed was d/c'd immediately following
   cardioversion.  After 1.5 hours she again went into afib/flutter and
   dropped her blood pressure.  She was given amiodarone bolus of 150mg
   and started on a drip and again cardioverted with 150 J.  She had
   several short episodes of recurrant afib/flutter and dips in her blood
   pressure to MAP's 45-50.  She was briefly restarted on levophed however
   this was discontinued due to recurrant afib.  She was then given 100mg
   albumin with stabilization of her BP with MAP's in the 50's.

 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   42 y/o F with Common VID, HepC cirrhosis/ESLD, h/o cryptosporidium in
   the past, Type 1 DM, presenting with c. diff sepsis, c/b ARDS and
   respiratory failure s/p trach, as well as pseudomonal VAP and [**Female First Name (un) 459**],
   now with ARF on CVVH
   .
   #Unstable Atrial fibrillation
 required amiodarone gtt and
   cardioversion for Afib with RVR with MAP ~39-45, since starting
   amiodarone and giving 100g IV albumin.  Likely [**12-20**] underlying
   multiorgan dysfunction and volume shifts with CVVH.
   -continue amio gtt
   -conservative volume removal with CVVH
   .
   # Sepsis/Infection:  Initially presented with C.diff sepsis now s/p
   Xigris and IVIG.  Her colitis appeared improved on serial CT scans of
   the abdomen.  She has remained afebrile with stable lactate.   Scope
   was deferred due to risk of perforation.  She then developed fever,
   respiratory distress, and concern for VAP.  Initial BAL neg but treated
   with meropenem [**1-30**] x8 days.  Sputum cx on [**2-9**] grew pseudomonas.  She
   was restarted on meropenem, vanco D/Cd [**2-4**].  Micofungin added [**1-31**],
   d/c
d [**2-3**].  Sinus CT findings raised concern for  sinusitis but was
   impossible to say definitively, getting nasal NS.   WBC also started to
   increase from 22 to 34 but remained afebrile.  Cultured broadly, so far
   negative except [**Female First Name (un) 459**] in urinet.   CT abdomen/pelvic [**2-10**] was
   unremarkable.   Paracentesis [**2-10**] unremarkable.
   Now patient is stable on broad antimicrobials, being treated for her C.
   diff, pseudomonal VAP, as well as urinary [**Female First Name (un) 459**]/thrush.  She remains
   afebrile off pressors.
   - C. diff colitis: Cont PO Vanco for C.diff (Flagyl D/Cd due to
   thrombocytopenia) -> cont to 2wks after completing other antbx
   - Pseudomonal VAP: Cont meropenem x15 days through [**2-24**] (d1=[**2-10**]).  Was
   on vanco initially though stopped [**2-12**].
   - Cont to trend WBC, fever curve
   - f/u blood cultures
   -dose IVIG weekly Q Saturday
   - check SPEP on [**3391-2-18**]
   - On trophic TFs
   .
   # HCV Cirrhosis/ESLD:  Chronic HCV infection. Liver consult team
   following.  Transaminases stable.  Bilirubin has been trending
   upwards.  Likely related to acute infection and poor liver
   compensation.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to medications.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have
   component of hemolysis.  U/S [**2-14**] with poor portal flow, no other acute
   processes.  No obvious thrombosis.  INR also indicative of
   decompensated liver disease, INR 3.2 today.  Also malnuourished.  DIC
   panel negative.  Vit K no help.
   Coagulopathy:
   - Cont to trend INR
   - Transfuse FFP prn for bleeding
   - Close monitoring for other causes -> ie DIC [**Month/Year (2) **]
   - No signs of bleeding currently
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Stable.  Likely related to sepsis and
   pneumonia.  Given deconditioning, it likely resulted in failure to
   wean.  Now s/p trach.  Intermittently becomes agitated on the vent.
   Oxygenating well.  ABGs stable.
   - Continue vent for now; try to place on TM with only vent for
   transitioning once acute issues stabilized
   - Wean FIO2 prn
   - Attempted diuresis [**2-11**], now on CVVH -> MAP 55 acceptable
   - Trial of pressure support for comfort prn
   # Mental status: Was somewhat decreased over the last few days, with
   concern for new infection given abx stopped on [**2-6**]. CT head [**2-10**] w/o
   acute process.  Likely some component of hepatic / toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy as was not getting lactulose.  Unchanged today.
   - Limit sedating meds; treat infection as above
   - CVVH per Renal to potentially clear uremia
   - Starting lactulose today
   .
   # SVT- likely volume and electrolytes changes related vs MOSD
   - s/p CV
   - amiodarone gtt, no clear guidelines for liver disease
   - will continue amio loading for now given unclear trigger
   - decrease amount of volume removal on CVVH given this was possible
   trigger
   .
   # Renal Failure:  Likely HRS vs ATN or severe pre-renal, though total
   body overloaded. FeUrea <.1, EOS in urine.  ? related to Vanco and [**Last Name (un) 339**]
   though unclear.  Hyperkalemic [**2-4**] treated for hyperK with calcium,
   bicarb, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate. Checked 4h CrCl on [**2-7**]
   which was 22 (very poor).
   - Appreciate Renal c/s,  started CVVH [**2-12**] -> held for 8hrs today, will
   resume afterwards
   - Albumin PRN, but will not give standing
   - Renally dose meds
   - On Midodrine / Octreotine for HRS (started once urine lytes [**2-11**] with
   Na < 10)
   - No need to give kayexalate as is on CVVH
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  HCT stable.  Neg DIC [**Month/Year (2) **].  s/p 2 units
   prbcs 2/29/09.  Likely multifactorial, no obvious signs of bleeding.
   Plt <100 [**2-12**] though appears to be stabilizing.  Increased to 93
   today.  ? medication effect.  Had been worsening over the last few days
   in the setting of vanco and other antibiotics.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to
   liver failure and low thrombopoeitin, as well as splenic
   sequestration.  Not thought to be HIT given many other reasons to be
   thrombocytopenic
   - Trend HCT, transfuse for HCT<21; last transfused 2u PRBC [**3391-2-13**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T/S
   - Guaiac stools & daily HCT
   - Started epo [**2-11**]
   - Trend Plts -> DIC neg
   - D/C Flagyl yesterday
   - Blood smear with 2+ schistocytes, ? low grade DIC, cont to monitor
   # DM Type I: Developed DKA while here. Hypoglycemic intermittently
   overnight, glucose has been difficult to control.
   - trophic TFs restart [**3391-2-13**]
   - D/C TPN
   - Will need insulin support
   Hyperbili:

   Encephalopathy:
   - Restart lactulose PO
   # Pain Management: Less of an issue given current mental status
