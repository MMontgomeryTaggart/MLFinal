Chief Complaint:
The patient had been in rehab since last D/C unti he was seen by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1126**] [**9-12**]. CT showed complex fluid collection below the
lower pole of the incision which corresponded to an area of
wound
breakdown. He was taken to the OR for I+D.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2987-9-17**]: Sternal debridement, removal of hardware x3, and left
pectoralis muscular flap based on the thoracoacromial vessels.
[**2987-9-14**] wound exploration, removal of inf plate, vac placed


History of Present Illness:
51 y/o M s/p emergent CABGx4 w/ IABP on [**7-1**] with post op course
complicated by Afib, LV thrombus, DVT, CVA with L sided weakness
and repiratory failure requiring trach and PEG s/p sternal
plating on [**8-20**] for infected sternum.
The patient had been in rehab since last D/C, he was seen by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 1126**] [**9-12**].
Achest Ct done at that time revealed a fluid collection at the
lower pole of incision and he was brought to the operating room
for drainage and debridement.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2987-9-17**] 4:08
PM
 UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:  52 year old man s/p pec flap
Final Report
AP SEMI-UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: Interval removal of the
sternal
plating hardware is performed. The right costophrenic angle is
excluded from the field of view. There is no pleural effusion.
Within these limitations, there is no pneumothorax. Heart size
is borderline enlarged. Hilar contours are unremarkable. There
is no pulmonary edema.
A left PICC is extending up to the cavoatrial junction or
probably upper right atrium. There is a second looped wire
projecting over the mediastinum, which could be external to the
patient. Tracheostomy tube is in standard location.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pleural effusion within the
limitations of a
partially excluded right costophrenic angle.


Radiology Report CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2987-9-13**] 9:28
AM
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: 52 year old man with h/o MRSA
sternal osteomyelitis s/p prior CABG s/p debridement/plates
placed in early [**Month (only) 439**], now with increased tenderness, erythema
in inferior 3rd of sternum, elevated inflamm markers
Final Report
Since [**8-10**], sternal wires have been removed and transverse
costosternal
stabilization plates have been applied. At all levels, there is
failure of
fusion of the sternotomy and the extent of separation between
the sternal
fragments is either stable or in the lower sternum increased. At
several
levels the widening is due to both diastasis and bone
resorption. For example at 10 cm inferior to the sternal notch,
3:33, the transverse diameter of the right fragment is 14.4 mm
now, previously 16.2 mm, and the left is 12.5 mm, previously
16.6 mm while the width of separation is now 10.5 mm, previously
5.6 mm. Similar findings are present continuously from that
level to the xiphoid.
Apparent thickening of the caliber of the pectoralis major
muscle that may be due to difference in arm position, but there
is subcutaneous emphysema of the midline, anterior chest wall at
several levels.
In the midline presternal soft tissues, 1.5 cm inferior to the
sternal notch is a collection of small gas bubbles in the
thickened muscle. Although the previous midline collection that
ran anterior to the manubrium and upper sternal body has been
drained, starting 12 cm inferior to the sternal notch, 2:36, and
running for at least 6 cm inferiorly, and adjacent to the levels
of maximum sternal resorption, is a new midline fluid collection
with irregular margins, and maximum transverse diameters of 37 x
23 mm, 2:38. The small volume of retrosternal fluid at these
levels is inseparable from a small pericardial effusion at the
junction of the lower sternal body with the xiphoid, 2:40-44.
Although these intrathoracic fluid collections are unchanged
since [**8-10**], since they are contiguous with the new,
presumably purulent presternal collection, the transthoracic
extension of infection cannot be excluded.
Respiratory motion obscures some of the fine detail in the lung,
but there is no pulmonary edema, consolidation, substantial
atelectasis and or any nodule.  Tiny bilateral pleural effusions
and small pericardial effusion are unchanged. Enlargement of the
upper paratracheal lymph nodes has decreased, but the right
lower paratracheal complex is 22 mm across in aggregate,
previously 19 mm and left lower paratracheal and prevascular
nodes have grown from 5 mm to 9 and 8 mm wide respectively.
Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, particularly due
to a dilated left ventricle, has increased.
This study is not designed for assessment of the upper abdomen,
but there is no indication of extension of infection to that
region. A gastrostomy tube has a normal appearance.
IMPRESSION:
1. Development of new lower midline presternal collection (after
drainage of the upper portion) and sternal separation,
presumably infectious. Multifocal bone resorption of the sternal
fragments has progressed, concerning for multilevel
osteomyelitis. Edema of the lower anterior chest wall does not
necessarily represent tissue infection. The only reason to
presume that a small retrosternal collection and small
pericardial effusion, at the levels of the new lower presternal
abscess, are not infected, is that neither has enlarged or
developed gas collections since late [**7-20**]. Moderate cardiomegaly, predominantly left ventricular,
increased. No
pulmonary edema or increase in tiny pleural effusions.
3. Tracheostomy, percutaneous gastrostomy, standard appearance.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3466**] was admitted for sternal wound debridement and hardware
removal. Following the procedure a wound vac was placed and the
patient was tranferred to the CVICU for further monitoring. He
remained in the ICU with the VAC dressing in place until he was
brought back to the operating room for further debridement and
pectoralis flap advancement. He tolerated this procedure well
and returned to the ICU in stable condition. The following day
he was transferred to the stepdown floor for continued care. He
failed a swallow evaluation and thus [**Last Name (un) 3650**] tube feeds were
continued. He continued to be followed by Plastic surgery and
infectious diseases services. Coumadin was resumed with a
heparin drip (1600 units per hour) as his INR had not reached a
therapeutic range (2.0-3.0). He received 2.5mg on [**2987-9-19**] and 5mg
on [**2987-9-20**]. He will require referral back to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3649**] or Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 306**] for coumadin follow-up upon discharge from rehab. The
remainder of his hospital course was uneventful. On [**2987-9-20**] it
was decided he was ready for return to rehabilitation at
[**Hospital3 3651**] in [**Hospital1 1277**] NH. He will continue on
vancomycin and Imipenum to total six weeks. He will require
weekly labs every monday which will consist of a CBC, ESR, CRP,
BUN, Creatinine, vancomycin trough and LFT's with results faxed
to Infectious disease at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 958**]. He will remain on tube
feeds until his oral intake is adequate and will benefit from
close follow-up with speech and swallow. Electrolytes should be
checked while receiving tube feeds. He will also require
aggressive physical and occupational therapy.
