   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 1 overnight
   - Continue to monitor in ICU with possible call-out to cardiology
   service later today if blood pressures stabilize
   - D/c vanco as treated for 48 hours with continued negative culture
   data; Afebrile
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. No repeat episodes of v tach
   since admission.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Appreciate cardiology input- per cards, additional 150 mg IV
   amiodarone as well as maintenance oral amiodarone dose increase to 400
   mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam. Sating 99-100% RA
   - Diuresis when able.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Will d/c vanco as Afebrile, cultures negative
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.  ? R chest hematoma however crit
   stable.
   - Vascular following.
   - Lower extremity wound care per vascular
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult; may need plastics intervention as well.
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB
   # CKD.  Consistent with recent baseline.  Will follow.
