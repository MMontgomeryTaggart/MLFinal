UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: 60 year old man with CABG/MVrep
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ? after CT removal
Final Report
CHEST, AP: Examination is limited by underpenetration.
Endotracheal tube,
nasogastric tube, mediastinal drains, and chest tubes have been
removed.
Swan-Ganz catheter remains in standard position. There is no
pneumothorax.
Moderate layering left effusion persists. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stably enlarged, post-CABG and mitral valve
replacement. Lung volumes are low, with mild bibasilar
atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Post-operative changes. Moderate left effusion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Elongated LA. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA. Good (>20
cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. All four pulmonary veins identified
and enter the left atrium.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately
dilated LV cavity. Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Inferobasal LV aneurysm. Moderately depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Moderate (2+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.
Physiologic TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Suboptimal image
quality. Frequent atrial premature beats. Results were
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body
of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the lateral,
anterolateral and inferolateral walls. The rest of the walls are
moderately depressed. There is a likely inferobasal left
ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately to severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %). The right
ventricle displays moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
centrally directed mitral regurgitation is seen. It is likely
due to a combination of bileaflet restriction and annular
dilitation. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 222**] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room at the time of the study.
POST BYPASS The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion.
The patient is being atrial paced. Right ventricular free wall
systolic function is improved and is now normal. The left
ventricle dispalys improved function as well. The lateral,
anterolateral, and inferolateral walls are still mild to
moderately hypokinetic. The ejection fraction is about 45%. A
mitral annular ring is in situ. There is trace to mild mitral
regurgitation. The peak gradient across the mitral valve is 11
mmHg with a mean gradient of 7 mmHg at a cardiac output of 9
liters/minute. The thoracic aorta appears intact. No other
significant changes from the pre-bypass study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 4**] for coronary artery bypass grafting and
mitral valve repair versus replacement. He was found to have a
Klebsiella urinary tract infection and was treated
preoperatively with IV cefepime. On [**5-27**] he was brought to the
operating room please see operative report for details. He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.
He remained hemodynamically stable in the immediate
post-operative period, woke nuerologically intact and was
extubated. On POD1 he was transferred from the cardiac surgery
ICU to the stepdown unit. All tubes, lines and drains were
removed per cardiac surgery protocol. Once on the stepdown unit
he worked with physical therapy and nursing to increase her
activity and endurance. The remainder of his post operative
course was uneventful. On POD four he was discharged home with
services.
