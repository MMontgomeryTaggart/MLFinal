   Assessment and Plan
   78 year-old man with history as above who was referred from OSH for a
   cardiac catheterization secondary to persistent shortness of breath. Pt
   had [**Year (4 digits) **] placed in distal RCA for 90% lesion.  Procedure was complicated
   for sigificant epistaxis following NGT placement.  Integrelin and
   heparin held.  Pt did receive plavix load and aspirin.
   PLAN:
   # Coronary Artery Disease - Known hx of CAD, prior CABG, prior
   stent/PTCA.  Cath showed distal 90% RCA lesion s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   placement.  Post cath check w/o complication.
   - continue ASA and plavix
   - fup am EKG
   - continue statin; tricor NF and will need to be restarted on d/c.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure - Ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. RHC
   notable for elevated RVEDP (16 mm Hg) and PCWP (28 mm Hg mean).  Mean
   wedge 28 on cath yesterday and pt got 1L fluid for renal protection.
   - cont lasix diuresis 80mg IV lasix this am then prn
   - Continue Inspra, Diovan and Toprol
   - cont [**Name (NI) 223**]
 pt with previous worsening Cr on ACEI.
   - Daily weight, 2 liter fluid restriction and 2 gram Na diet
   .
   # Ventilator-Assisted Breathing - Intubated for inability to tolerate
   cath [**1-20**] anxiety and PTSD, remained extubated [**1-20**] extensive nosebleed.
   - plan for extubation today.
   .
   Epistaxis
 resolved.  Treated with Afrin, EBL ~200cc, OGT in place
   - ENT following
   - Hct stable
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue Lasix, Diovan, Norvasc, Inspra and Toprol
   - Low sodium/Heart Healthy diet
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Most recent lipid panel not available
   - Continue statin, restart tricor on d/c and heart-healthy diet
   .
   # Type II Diabetes, Insulin-Dependent
   - Most recent HgA1c not available
   - Monitor FSBS QAC and HS with Humalog sliding scale coverage
   - Levemir HS
   - will hold standing am and hs doses while NPO and cover with SSI
   .
   # Stage 3 chronic renal failure - Baseline Cr 1.8, received pre-cath
   hydration and mucomyst. Cr 1.6 this am.
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - renally dose meds as needed
   .
   # Depression
   - Mood stable, patient frustrated with long wait for cath
   - Clarify if patient on Effexor and continue if so
   - Consider SW consult while hospitalized
   .
   # Access - 2 peripheral IVs
   .
   # FEN - Cardiac/Hearth Healthy/Low Sodium/Dietetic Diet once extubated,
   replete lytes prn
   .
   # Proph - SC heparin once cleared from epistaxis, Bowel regimen

   # Disposition - c/o tp floor once extubated
