   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # Mitral Regurgitation: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR
   but not a flail leaflet.
   - continue Hydral and Imdur given MR
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - continuing post cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and
   simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol and lisinopril 2/2 HR & BP limitations
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Platelets improved after transfusion to 98
   this am.  Thrombocytopenia thought to be [**1-11**] balloon pump in the past.
   Were improving but now worsening.  PF4 negative in the past, but HIT is
   possible.  DIC and hemolysis not likely on labs.
   - hematology consult appreciated.
   - repeat hep antibodies pending.
   - monitor platelets dialy
   - hold PPI
   - cont to hold heparin gtt and heparin flushes for now.
   # ARF:Most likely contrast nephropathy but has been slow to improve
   with continued oliguria. Work-up initiated for outpatient hemodialysis.
   Pt s/p tunnel line placement yesterday.
   - monitor uop
   - continue HD
   - will read PPD today.  hepatitis serologies pending
   - follow up renal recs
   - cont to hold lisinopril
   # Normocytic anemia:  Hct stable at 26.5 from 29, Fe studies
   unrevealing.
   - t/c transfusion
   - cont to monitor.
   # Diarrhea:  C Diff negative x3, symptoms improved.
   # Hyponatremia: Na 131, plan for HD today.  Hypervolemic.
   # Rhythm: aflutter/fib
 t/c anticoagulation after thrombocytopenia
   workup completed.
   - not anticoagulating with heparin [**1-11**] possible HIT.
   - continue amiodarone 200mg QD
   # Gout: Allopurinol QOD
