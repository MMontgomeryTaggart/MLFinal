TITLE: Sub-Intern (4^th year medical student) Admission Note
   CHIEF COMPLAINT: transfer from OSH for chest pain
   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
   The patient is a 48 y/o M Bulgarian with h/o dyslipidemia, possible DM,
   who was admitted to the CCU for further management of NSTEMI. The
   patient and his wife state that last evening at 9:30PM he was at the
   gym on the elliptical machine when he started to feel severe 9.5/10
   chest pain radiating to both shoulders without nausea or sweating. He
   was taken by ambulance to [**Hospital3 7317**] Hospital where an EKG
   showed [**Street Address(2) 3911**] elevation in aVR and 2-4 mm ST segment depressions in
   V3-V5. Initial biomarkers were normal, but subsequently returned this
   am with CK 443, MB 62, TnI 2.10. He was unresponsive to nitroglycerin
   and morphine, and continued to have 3/10 chest pain throughout the
   night.  This morning he was given plavix 600 mg [**Last Name (LF) 4**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], heparin, iv
   NTG, and Integrilin and transferred to [**Hospital1 17**] via helicopter for
   emergent cardiac cath which showed 100% occlusion of proximal LAD with
   thrombus. He underwent thrombectomy and Cypher stent placement which
   resulted in decent flow through LAD but poor flow through D1. He also
   had elevated filling pressures (RVEDP 24 mm Hg and PCWP mean 30), and
   low cardiac outcome (CI of 1.8). An echocardiogram showed severe
   wall-motion abnormality in the anterior wall distal [**3-3**] to apex (EF
   ~30%). Patient was then [**Last Name (un) 2089**] to the CCU and is now lying in bed flat
   without chest pain.
   Of note, in [**2575-12-29**] the patient had a stress ECG that showed no
   ST changes during exercise, stress echo with normal left ventricular
   wall motion; a resting echo showed EF of 55%. His first episode of
   similar chest pain occured at rest in [**2569**] and he has been having chest
   pain at rest for the past couple of months. He also used to take
   medication for cholesterol but stopped because of discomfort and
heaviness in my liver.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   The patient is a 48 y/o M Bulgarian with h/o dyslipidemia, possible DM,
   who was admitted to the CCU for further management of NSTEMI that
   occurred in the context of exertion. He was found to have severe
   occlusion of the LAD that most likely resulted in infarction of the
   myocardium and diastolic dysfunction, resulting in elevated filling
   pressures, decreased cardiac outcome, severe anterior wall motion
   abnormality, and EF of 30%. At this point the goal is to (1) prevent
   further infarction of myocardium with anticoagulation and by minimizing
   stress to the heart; (2) preserve cardiac function by minimize
   remodeling of his heart; (3) and control potential symptoms of heart
   failure (i.e. sob).
   # CV: The patient had an NSTEMI. In order to minimize the chance of
   further myocardial damage, we will administed the following:
   - [**Name2 (NI) **], plavix daily to decrease platelet response and risk of further
   clot.
   - Integrillin x24-48 h due to recent PCI.
   - Low-dose beta-blocker with goal HR 60s to decrease work-load on
   heart. Watch SBP to prevent hypotension.
   - Low-dose ace-inhibitor to decrease remodelling of heart and hopefully
   improve long-term outcome
   - High dose statin to decrease his dyslipidemia. He will need a fasting
   lipid panel to more formally evaluate his cholesterol.
   - Heparin IV, no boluses, to decrease the function of anti-thrombin and
   decrease his risk of further clot
   - Cycle CKs to look for resolution of his MI.
   # PULM: No issues. He is sating well on nasal canula.
   # GI: The patient has a history of GERD. Continue his PPI and
   administer [**Name2 (NI) **] with food. Patient can start a house diet once he is
   sitting up.
   # GU: He has a history of recurrent UTIs and prostatitis. We will
   continue him on his home meds of Bactrim [**Hospital1 7**].
   # MSK: Patient has history of gout. Although currently he does not have
   an acute attack, if symptoms return may consider starting indomethacin
   PRN.
   # ENDO: His fasting glucose was normal at 103 and HbA1C at 5.8, despite
   not taking any anti-diabtetes medications. He most likely does not have
   diabetes at this time and will not need insulin sliding scale during
   his stay.
   # NEURO: The patient has no evidence of any peripheral or central
   nervous system dysfunction. Due to decreased heart wall motion, we may
   become concerned for embolic stroke if his mental status changes
   acutely.
   # ACCESS: He currently has [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in his groin (due to recent cardiac
   cath). We will need to watch daily for bleeding (due to
   anti-coagulation) and for infection (watch white count and
   temperature). This line is currently being used but can be DC
d if it
   becomes problem, peripheral Ivs can be inserted instead.
   # CODE: Full
   # DISPO: Will consider the floor in a few days if he remains stable.
