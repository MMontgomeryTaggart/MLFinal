   Assessment and Plan
   79M w/ hx of critical AS (valve area 0.5cm2), sCHF (EF 40), alcoholic
   cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of
   AS, who no p/w persistent severe DOE due to critical AS now awaiting
   valvuloplasty, course complicated by sepsis.
   # Critical AS: AS critical by valve area and awaiting palliative
   valvuloplasy while Bacteremia clears. Volume status remains tenuous,
   and patient appears to be retaining. Limiting fluid intake as much as
   possible and utilizing phenylephrine to keep MAPs greater than 55
   because Dobutamine was complicated by tachycardia.
   -  Continue phenylephrine for MAPs greater than 55
   -  CXR to assess volume status
   -  Valvuloplasty later this week
   # New onset A fib: Noted on admission. Cardioversion [**5-26**]. Chads 2 is
   4. Was on heparin gtt on the floor but will d/c now given hct drop.
   Appears to be in NSR this am.
   -Continue Dofetelide
   # Sepsis: Urine culture growing coag. Neg staph and Blood cultures
   growing coag. Positive staph. No peripheral manifestations of
   endocarditis, and TTE negative for vegetations. No obvious sources for
   staph bacteremia. Sensitivities pending. C diff negative x1.
   - Continue Vancomycin but change to Once daily dosing. D/c Zosyn.
   - Follow culture data
   - repeat C diff
   # Acute renal failure: Cr up to 1.8 from 1.7 yesterday. Likely due to
   poor forward flow in the setting of sepsis and critical AS.
   - Trend Cr. Renally dose meds
   - Urine lytes
   # Cirrhosis: - Likely [**2-21**] EtOH use. Pt reports that he stopped drinking
   approx 1 year ago.documented on MRCP as well as CT abdomen. Pt
   hepatitis panel negative for Hep A,B,C. G positive stools may be due to
   upper GIB but no report of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6179**] so unlikely variceal bleed.
   In addition EGD [**3380-5-25**] without varices. EGD did show Erythema and
   congestion in the first part of the duodenum, second part of the
   duodenum and third part of the duodenum compatible with mild
   duodenitis. Given brown stools, and Hct drop, in the setting of
   heparin, history is most consistent with likely upper source of GIB.
   -2 pivs

   -Consider IV ppi
