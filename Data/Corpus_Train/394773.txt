   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**1-30**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5961**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5961**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 147**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx: covered with heparin which we are using for his
   Coumadin bridge
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace
   # CODE: full
   # DISPO: CCU for now, will likely be candidate for [**Hospital Ward Name 403**] 3 after the
   procedure

   Patient seen and examined with medical student and I agree with his
   physical exam and assessment/plan as noted below:
   Patient with a-flutter, plan for ablation this morning. Will d/c dilt
   gtt post-ablation as rate allows. On heparin gtt as bridge to coumadin
   for at least one month of treatment.  TEE this morning without evidence
   of clot. Will restart on ACE-I today and add on BB as bp
s tolerate.
