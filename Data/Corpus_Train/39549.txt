Hepatitis Panel pending at the time of discharge

EGD [**Last Name (LF) 1490**], [**3048-2-14**]:
Impression: Mild erythema in the whole Esophagus compatible with
Mild esophagitis likely secondary to thermal injury
Erosions in the stomach body likely secondary to thermal injury
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 19 year old man with a history of depression who
presented with acute dysphagia and odynophagia after ingesting
scalding salt water and sustaining an oropharyngeal burn.
.
# Ingestion injury: ENT and GI was consulted in the ED and
recommended ICU monitoring for airway protection. He was
intially admitted to the MICU and received three doses of
decadron. He had no evidence of airway compromise at the time of
admission. He remained stable without evidence of airway edema
overnight. He also reported decreased discomfort and tolerated a
liquid diet. Therefore, he was transfered to the floor in stable
condition the following evening. He was also treated with IV
pantoprazole. An EGD was performed and showed thermal damage to
the stomach and esophagus. GI believed that these lesions would
resolve completely with avoidance of further injurious agents.
He will follow up with GI on [**3048-2-23**] and with ENT on [**3048-2-25**] to
reassess injury and monitor resolution.  GI will likely perform
a repeat EGD to assess for resolution of his injury. He was
discharged on Sucralfate 1 gm PO/NG QID and a PPI.
.
# Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient was found to have
elevated LFTS (ASTs (91 [**3048-2-14**], 92 [**3048-2-15**] and ALTs 45 [**3048-2-14**],
57 [**3048-2-15**]). Viral hepatitis serologies were sent. These were
pending at the time of discharge. We instructed the patient to
follow the results of these tests with his primary care
physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7946**] [**Name (STitle) **] on
[**3048-2-22**].
.
# Depression: Patient had a history of depression. He denied any
thoughts of suicide or intents to harm himself. He should follow
up with his PCP for further management.
.
# Substance abuse: Patient reported approximately [**2-19**] drinks on
social occasions. We encouraged him to abstain from alcohol and
other substances.

Discharge Instructions:
Thank you for allowing us to take part in your care. You were
admitted after you drank very hot liquid. You had two
procedures. We looked at your esophagus and stomach and showed
some damage caused by the hot liquid. You had another procedure
looking at your throat that showed burns to the oropharynx,
larynx and epiglottis.

You are able to eat soft foods and drink cool liquids.

We made the following changes to your medications:

We STARTED omeprazole.
We STARTED sucralfate (Carafate).

The omeprazole and sucralfate will protect your stomach and
esophagus from further damage. You should take omeprazole and
sucralfate until told to stop by a physician.

You had mildly elevated liver enzymes in your blood that are a
sign of liver injury.  There are many potential causes of
elevated liver enzymes and these causes should be followed up
through your primary doctor. We did lab tests for viral
hepatitis. The results are not yet back from the lab. You will
need to see your primary care physician for the results of these
tests.

We would like you to avoid alcohol and other intoxicating
substances to prevent further injury to your stomach and
esophagus. We would also like you to stay away from hot foods
and liquids as well as rough or hard foods that could further
damage your throat.
