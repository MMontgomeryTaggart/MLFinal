Chief Complaint:  dyspnea
   HPI:
   This is an 83 year old woman who is transferred to us from the general
   surgical service POD3 s/p ileocecectomy for a colonic lesion identified
   as adenocarcinoma by colonoscopy. Her operation evidently was without
   complication with anastomosis made without difficulty by staple and
   silks and the abdominal incision healing well post-operatively. She has
   had a hematocrit drop post-operatively but has been stable. Overnight
   by report of the surgical resident she became tachypneic and was having
   progressively lower O2 sats. She was given 10 mg IV lasix (apparently
   x3 doses; at 1650 on the day prior to transfer, which was then followed
   by 500 ml NS over 2 hours also recorded at 1650; then with another 10
   mg at 0050, and another at 0225) to which she had some urine output but
   her oxygen saturation did not improve. The initial trigger note was
   written at 0040 on the morning of transfer and noted that she was
   satting 85% on 3L, then 90% on 6L NC evidently plus nebulizer at 0.70
   FiO2. She was maintained on a NRB but continued to have respiratory
   difficult and did not improve, at which point in the morning she was
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for further evaluation and care.
   In the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**], she denied chest pain or chest tightness. She was
   complaining of cough (and coughing up small amounts of brownish/
   rust-colored sputum) and was finding her mask to be uncomfortable. She
   said she had abdominal pain only with coughing. She was also noting
   that for the past three days after her operation she was having
   hallucinations although she was able to distinguish this from reality.
   She was fully oriented.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 year old woman with past Afib and hypertension who is now
   POD 3 s/p ileocecectomy.
   DYSPNEA / HYPOXIA
   Ongoing evidence of worsening pulmonary edema. Unclear reason. No past
   dx of heart failure, but has been 4.5 liters up post-op. Currently
   cardiac enzymes are negative. EKG changes probably c/w demand [**3-3**] afib
   and tachycardia, but may be concerning for ischemia; may suggest R
   heart strain, is potentially concerning for PE although if pulm edema
   is evidence of left heart failure this would argue against a pulm
   source of R heart failure; no signs of R heart failure currently
   peripherally. Evolving CXR is not symmetrical, concern for possible
   aspiration
 pneumonia although evolving pulm edema is probably still
   more likely; lack of fever not persuasive argument against PNA given pt
   age.
   -          cycle cardiac enzymes
   -          cardiac echo
   -          CTA once able to lay flat, less agitated; post lasix if
   continuing to have good urine output; check lytes to ensure OK renal
   function for contrast
   -          Follow EKG
   -          Hi-flow mask for now, low threshold for BiPAP; may intubate
   if needed but holding O2 sats for now
   -          Control HR; sent down on home atenolol which she got at 0330
   today. Advancing metoprolol.
   -          Consider afterload reduction if continuing to worsen w high
   BP
   -          Start zosyn to cover HAP including pseudomonas given time on
   vent in OR, etc
   -          Sending blood cultures
   -          Giving aspirin
   DELIRIUM
   Hallucinating, some agitation (picking at bedclothes); remains oriented
   to place, year, and situation. Most likely hospital delirium. Question
   of benzo w/d but no tremor; anxiety not a prominent feature. Hypoxia is
   likely contributor although she reportedly has had this problem since
   after her surgery, arguing for earlier onset of delirium. Was on
   reglan, this was d/c
ed earlier by surgical team.
   -          try low doze zydis for now; Haldol if not effective
   -          monitor closely for signs of benzo w/d
   -          UA, UCx
   POST-ABDOMINAL SURGERY
   Cautious low-dose opiates for pain prn. Concern for delirium.
   -          Monitor BMs closely.
   -          Increase bowel regimen.
   -          Per surgery, may advance diet given +flatus; would do so v
   cautiously given delirium, supervised sips only for now, ADAT if safe
   DMII
   Holding home metformin. Continue ISS, FSBS.
   HTN
   While in unit moving atenolol back to metoprolol, starting this at MN
   tonight given has already received atenolol. Normotensive currently in
   setting of afib, received atenolol and verapamil.
   -      advancing metoprolol, holding atenolol, for greater speed of
   response and flexibility
   -      continue verapamil but see below
   AFIB
   See above re metoprolol. Continue verapamil for now; she will be having
   effects of verapamil+atenolol through the day today. Continuing to be
   in afib but not in RVR at this point.
   -          Increasing metoprolol for now, give IV to cover increasing
   rate
   PAIN
   Can receive prn opiates if needed. Given delirium, and b/c pt now
   denying pain, have not put this in as an order yet, but monitor
   closely.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.I would emphasize and add
   the following points:  83 yo F with a-fib, htn, dm, post-op day 3 from
   ileocecectomy (for colon adeno ca) transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for increasing
   dyspnea, hypoxia, and delerium. Tachycardic but not hypotensive.
   Progressive increase in O2 requirements yesterday despite lasix now on
   100% NRB. CXR appears most c/w failure.. Given lasix 40 IV
   peritransfer--> 1 L u/out since arrival to ICU.  Abg --> 7.49/35/75
   (high flow 100%).
   PMH--A-fib, DM, htn
   fm, sh, meds, as per resident h and p.
   Exam notable for Tm AF  BP 141/77  HR a-fib 80-90's--> 110's  RR 30
   with sat on 99-100% high flow .
   Elderly F, confused, but oriented, without acc muscle use, coarse
   BS/rales throughout, [**Last Name (un) **] tachy, +bs, soft, trace edema
   Labs notable for WBC 10 K,  HCT 29, plt  215   K+ 3.7, Cr   0.8, trop
   0.04, c k222
   CXR with evolving diffuse b/l pulm edema, full hilar vessels, small
   lung volumes, prob sm L effusion
   EKG change in qrs axis 1, 3, TW flattening 2, 3, 1mm st dep in V2.
   Issues include:
     * Hypoxemia
     * Resp alkalosis
     * Pulmonary edema/diffuse asd
     * htn,
     * atrial fibrillation,
     * delerium/AMS
     * trop elevation, probable demand ischemia
   Cxr appearance is most c/w pulm edema though pna/asd possible.  PE
   seems much less likely given the abnormal cxr finding to explain
   hypoxemia and elevated bp. Agree with plan to diurese with lasix and
   rate control with bb and optimize bp.  Consider low dose
   morphine/nitro.   Could try nippv though pt unlikely to tolerate given
   agitation. If unable to wean o2 and pt with increased wob/fatigue will
   need intubation.   Follow serial cardiac enzymes given elevated initial
   trop --? demand ischemia vs acs.  Give asa (clear with surgery) and
   heparin gtt if repeat trop elevated.  TTE. Consider cta pending
   additional w/u given higher concern for chf,, as ct will also provide
   additional info on lung parecnchyma.  Pt too agitated to tolerate lying
   still and would require intubation for procedure. Given lower
   suspicion, will start with lenis, tte.  Cover empirically with
   zosyn/vanco given slightly assym appearance of cxr findings, though
   without leukocytosis infection is lower ddx and send cxs.  Delerium
   likely post-op in elderly pt, but infection or less likely benzo
   withdrawal could play role.  C/s pysch for input on management given
   high outpt use of xanax, give zyprexa/haldol for agitation and follow
   ecg.  Check tsh, b12, folate. Post=op management and additional input
   per surgery team.   PIVs.  A-line if pt able to tolerate, sq hep, ssi.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
