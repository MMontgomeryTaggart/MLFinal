Chief Complaint:  Shortness of breath, desaturation
   HPI:
   This is a 50 year old woman with a history of T2 paraplegia and
   recurrent pneumonias who was recently found to have pneumonia and
   started on levofloxacin who presents with SOB and desaturation in the
   80s at home.
   Several days ago she developed shortness of breath, worsening and
   productive cough and elevated temp and presented to her PCP's office
   where a CXR was consistent with pneumonia. She was started on
   levofloxacin and continued treatment at home. She uses 02 at home and
   has oxygen saturation monitor. Yesterday, one day after treatment
   started, she complained of worsening shortness of breath and her O2 sat
   decreased to 80s, while at room air. Also noted fever at 101. Her
   husband noted that she and lethargic. She presented to ED where she was
   noted to have a low blood pressure (SBP 70s, HR 94) and new TW
   inversions on lateral leads. First set CE was negative. She underwent
   central line placement and was given intravenous fluid ressucitation.
   Subsequently her SBP was noted in the 100s. Her oxygen saturations
   remained stable in mid to high 90s on 3 Lt, RR 20. CXR showed RLL
   infiltrate and although she did not have leukocytosis (WBC 9) she had
   80% PMNs and 10% lymphs.  She was given vancomycin and pip/tazo as
   empirical treatment for CAP that failed to symptomatically improve with
   outpaitne levofloxacin therapy.
   She was admitted at [**Hospital1 **] (MICU then wards) one month ago with these same
   symptoms, i.e. dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension. She was diagnosed
   with HAP and treated with vanc and pip/tazo through a PICC line which
   was discontinued on discharge. She was given a brief course of
   norepinephrine while in the MICU.
   On the floor, she is denies any symptoms and feels comfortable.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 year old woman with a history of T2 paraplegia and
   recurrent pneumonias who was recently found to have pneumonia and
   started on levofloxacin who presents with dyspnea and oxygen
   desaturation.
   # Fever, SOB, hypoTN, desaturation, CXR evidence of infiltrate: Likely
   CAP in the background of recurrent pulmonary infections. Note that her
   CXR appears unchanged compared to one month ago, but her symptoms and
   past history are suggestive on PNA. She did not have recurrent PNAs
   prior to her MVA, suggesting that her predisposing factor is poor
   clearance of secretions in setting of T2 paraplegia. Has had pneumovax
   and flu shot; both several months ago. In addition, the history of
   smoking suggests an underlying COPD like picture which may also
   predispose her to recurrent infection. Alternatively, micro aspiration
   may be contributing. H/O of pulmonary nodules, but of unclear relevance
   in this presentation (very low concern for malignancy).  CHF, PE highly
   unlikely. Since her symptoms became worse despite levofloxacin will
   treat with broad spectrum abx untill further speciation (sputum cx,
   blood cx, urine legionella sent). Will continue vanc and pip/tazo and
   tailor based on cx. If no growth will treat with levo for 7 days. Will
   continue 02 prn for O2 sats >90. Monitor RR and mental status, if
   fatigued or cannot protect a/w will intubate. Given coarseness on exam
   will add nebs and expectorant. IVF as needed to keep MAP >65. S/S c/s.
   Currently no evidence of SIRS. If fluid unresponsive (as per past
   history), neosynephrine.
   # TW inversion in anterior leads, in otherwise asymptomatic patient:
   Unlikely ACS. Will romi with three sets and ECG.
   # h/o DVT in [**3418**] s/p IVC filter placed in [**3418**]: SQ heparin ppx
   # Normocytic anemia (baseline 25-30): HCT 32 and stable at
   presentation.
   # Chronic pain: continue methadone and prn oxycodone; both with holding
   parameters
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine.
   # Depression: continue citalopram
   # Constipation: senna docussate miralax
   # FEN: PRN IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Code: Full
   # Communication: Patient

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 50F T2 paraplegia, recurrent pneumonia, p/w
   fevers (101) and progressive hypoxemia with RA sat down to mid 80s. SBP
   80s in ED - CVL placed, given 2L IVF with resolution of hypotension.
   CXR c ? RLL infiltrate - mostly chronic changes.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.8 BP 118/77 HR 76 RR 18 with sat 96 on 2L. WD
   woman, JVD 8cm. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS, trace edema. Labs
   notable for WBC 9K, HCT 32, K+ 4.3, Cr 0.5. CXR with chronic RLL
   changes.
   Agree with plan to manage likely pneumonia with vanco / zosyn, but
   would narrow this quickly if CXR does not progress and cultures are
   negative. BP has resolved with fluid resuscitation; will check CVP,
   CvO2, and f/u lactate but looks euvolemic on exam. Will continue CPT
   and try a flutter valve to help with mobilization of secretions. Her
   chronic lung disease is not well quantified - chronic elevation in HCO3
   with risks for both obstructive and restrictive disease. Will notify
   PCP of admission and continue remainder of home meds. Remainder of plan
   as outlined above.
