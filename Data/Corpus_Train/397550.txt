Cardiology Consult
   Asked by MICU team to consult on this complex 69f to assist with
   hemodynamic management.
   HPI
   69f admitted [**6-16**] from nursing home.  Her recent history is notable for
   severe PVD s/p [**Name (NI) **] CFA
 PT bypass on [**3302-4-18**], wound infections &
   revisions, most recently [**6-12**].  Discharged to rehab on [**6-15**], but
   immediately bounced back with mental status changes, hypotension,
   hypoxemia, and rapid atrial fibrillation.  She was intubated in the
   emergency room and admitted to the MICU.
   Echo as below; CT-Angiogram showed RML arterial filling defect, ?
   chronic PE, R subclavian artery occlusion, recurrent invasive lung
   cancer.
   Her course here has been notable for labile hemodynamics, seemingly
   worse when extubated and improving when re-intubated (as happened
   yesterday), after her extubation course degenerated with confusion,
   unrepsonsiveness, and hyptonsion requiring dopamine and levophed..
   No clear infectious etiology for her decompensation yet identified,
   though broadly covered.
   Currently intubated, unable to obtain a cardiac or general review of
   systems.
   PMH
H/o lung cancer w/prior RLLectomy; recent imaging suggestive of recurrent metast
atic disease.
PAD as above

Tyroid disease s/p thyroidectomy
H/o orthostatic hypotension, on midodrine/florinef as outpatient
   Echo ([**6-16**])
 Limited study with biventricular dysfunction, LVEF 30%,
   RV dysfunction/dilation, 2+ MR, [**2-28**]+ TR, no effusion
   Telemetry -
   ECG

   changes.
