Admission Date:  [**3288-9-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**3288-9-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**3225-8-23**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease since [**3279**].
He has had a series of positive stress tests.  The cardiac
catheterization performed in [**3284-5-15**] then showed a totally
occluded right coronary artery with a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 70%.  The patient was continued to be
managed medically and was followed with annual stress
echocardiograms.  For the past few years, the patient reports
that he has had exertional chest pain and shortness of breath
with activity such as pushing the lawn mower or walking one
block down the street.  He also reported occasional episodes
of dizziness.  He denied any symptoms at rest.  His most
recent stress echocardiogram showed mild ST changes, chest
pain and inferior/posterior wall motion abnormalities.  He
was consequently referred for another cardiac catheterization
for a further evaluation.  The patient also denies any
symptoms of claudication, orthopnea, edema, or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  Cardiac catheterization performed on
[**3288-9-20**] revealed right coronary artery and left main
coronary artery disease in addition to mild diastolic left
ventricular dysfunction.  Calculated ejection fraction was
62%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease; 2.
Hypertension; 3.  Hyperlipidemia; 4.  History of shingles two
months ago.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Anal fissurectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Possible allergy to contrast dye.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day;
Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day; Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q. day;
Isordil 60 mg p.o. q. day; Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q. day; Mavik 1
mg p.o. q. day; Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q. day.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission revealed
hematocrit of 40.2, white blood cell count 6.3, platelets
213, urine analysis negative.  Glucose 134, BUN 15,
creatinine 0.7, sodium 137, potassium 4.2.  ALT 40, AST 28,
alkaline phosphatase 109, amylase 41.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the results of the cardiac
catheterization the patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Surgery Service for a coronary artery bypass graft.  On
[**3288-9-21**], the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting times five with a left internal mammary to the left
anterior descending coronary artery; radial artery to the
distal right coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein graft
from the aorta to the left anterior descending diagonal
coronary artery and reversed saphenous vein graft from the
aorta in sequence from the first obtuse marginal coronary
artery and sequence to the second obtuse marginal coronary
artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There
were no complications.  Please see the full operative report
for details.  After the procedure the patient was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The
patient was extubated on the same day in the evening.  He
remained in stable condition.  He continued to make good
urine.  A good left radial and ulnar flow was confirmed by
pulse oximetry waveform.  On postoperative day #2, his
hematocrit was 29.7.  He was continued to be weaned off of
supplemental oxygen.  On postoperative day #2 the patient got
out of bed to chair.  Lopressor was started.  On
postoperative day #2 he was noted to have heartrate in the
120s to 130s range.  The rhythm was irregular.  The patient
was treated with intravenous Lopressor.  Physical therapy was
consulted who was following the patient throughout his
hospitalization.  On postoperative day #2 the patient was
transferred to the regular floor in stable condition.  On
postoperative day #3 the patient was noted to have runs of
irregular rhythm.  Electrophysiology Service was consulted.
It was thought that the patient was having frequent
intermittent postoperative atrial tachycardia.  His Beta
blocker was increased accordingly to control his heartrate.
The following night the patient had another run of irregular
rate which again was thought to be atrial tachycardia.  There
were no sustained arrhythmias noted.  The patient remained in
sinus rhythm without any arrhythmias throughout the last 36
hours of his hospitalization.  His basic wires were removed.
The patient was ambulating and was cleared by physical
therapy.  The patient was discharged to home on postoperative
day #5 in stable condition.
