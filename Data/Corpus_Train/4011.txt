Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival in the ED the patient had a GCS of 15 but was
somewhat lethargic with a systolic blood pressure in the
80s-100s. Pertinant findings on physical exam were a 3-4cm
laceration on the posterior scalp, a small laceration of the
right eyebrow, minimal abdominal tenderness on the right, and a
swollen right lateral malleolus. The FAST exam was negative and
there was no blood on the rectal exam. His toxicology screen was
positive for alcohol and amphetamines.

Of note in his radiographic studies was the abdominal CT, which
showed a grade 3 liver laceration with fluid in the pelvis. His
ankle x-rays were negative for fracture.

He was admitted to the Trauma ICU for observation and serial
hematocrits. His hematocrit remained steady while he was an
inpatient and he remained hemodynamically stable. He was
transferred to the floor, with no problems in advancement of his
diet or activity level. He continued to have ankle pain and,
after discussion with orthopedics, was discharged with the plan
to follow-up with an ankle MRI and the orthopedic clinic as an
outpatient. He was seen by physical therapy and discharged home
in good condition.
