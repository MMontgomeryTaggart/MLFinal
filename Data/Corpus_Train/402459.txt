   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6957**] is a 73 yo man with CAD, PVD, valvular heart dz s/p
   bioprosthetic AVR and MRV, on coumadin for atrial fibrillation who
   presents with melena and symptomatic anemia.
   .
   # GI bleeding: most likley upper source given melena.  Many etiologies
   are possible, including angioectasias (bleeding is painless), or peptic
   ulcer disease, or variceal bleed (given h/o congestive hepatopathy).
   Patient quite anemic with hct of 20.
   - reverse anticoagulation with 5mg po vitamin K + FFP
   - transfuse 4U pRBCs
   - type & cross 4 U
   - q 4 hour hct
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - GI to scope from above in AM.  Will need C-scope as well.
   - hold ASA
   .
   # CAD: No stents.  No recent angina.
   - hold ASA
   - hold BB in setting of hypotension & bleeding.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: rate controlled. hold anticoagulation.
   telemetry
   .
   # h/o CHF with Valvular heart disease: s/p bioprosthetic AVR & MRV.
   appears euvolemic.
   - hold lisinopril & BB given hypotension
   .
   # h/o stroke/carotid disease: stable
   .
   # emphesema: continue nebulizers
   .
   # OSA: should be evaluated for CPAP as an outpatient
   .
   # FEN/GI: NPO for scope.  PPI [**Hospital1 **]. hold lasix.
