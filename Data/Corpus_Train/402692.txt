   Assessment and Plan
 CHEST PAIN
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   83 year old man with complex medical issues presents from nursing
   facility after taking NTG for his chest pain that resulted in
   hypotension that subsequently resolved spontanously. Chest pain
   secondary to unstable angina/NSTEMI vs severe AS or both.
   #) Cardiac: Currently chest pain free. pt has CRI and in the setting of
   this his 2 sets of trop has been in the indetermined range with a
   negative ck. this makes an ACS scenario with unstable plaque rupture
   much less likely. he may have stable coronary artery disease with
   demand ischemia at times. We need to obtain his recent cardiac cath
   report from [**Hospital **] to help determine further the extend and amenability
   of it to revascularization. he also has severe AS and although we can
   present his case to the CT surgery i'd imagine he's perhaps not the
   best candidate. short of that we could entertain valvuloplasty as an
   alternative choice of therapy. his language barrier certainly makes it
   challenging in determine whether his symptoms are related to his AS.
   his echo called this severe as with valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. however
   the peak gradient is 39 and mean gradient is 20. whether this is
   secondary to a low output state due to his poor lv function vs genuine
   severe as is unclear at present. i think we have several priorities
   here. 1) optimize medical therapy for his cad and cardiac dysfunction.
   2) further evaluation of ongoing bloody stool and hematuria. 3) further
   evaluation of his coronary anatomy, coronary ischemia and severeity of
   AS.
   - i don't believe this gentleman is having an ACS and will not
   anticoagulate him at this point. Will continue home regimen of aspirin,
   zocor, lisinopril and metoprolol. his blood pressure and hr are in the
   lower range of normal where it should be.
   - from his lv dysfunction point of view he appears fairly well
   compensated. will continue chf meds of ace-i, beta blocker and standing
   dose lasix.
   - will need his recent cath report from [**Hospital **] with a view of possible
   repeat cath with right heart study, as study with dobutamine. pending
   on the result will discuss of options of medical therapy vs surgical
   option vs interventional options.
   .
   #) Pulmonary:
   - pt has mild pan expiratory wheeze. cxr suggestive of pneumonia but
   he's afebrile with a normal wcc.
   - will d/c abx and follow along clinically.
   .
   #) GI:
   - pt has no history of endoscopy. per wife he's had blood streak in his
   stool since admission in [**Hospital **] without further eval.
   - serial hct check
   - iv ppi
   - gi consult but doubt they'd be happy to pass endoscopy in the current
   setting. likely will require conservative therapy.
   - in view of his multiple issues will set transfusion criteria to hct
   of less than 30 persistently.
   .
   #) Hematuria:
   - no clot at present. per wife this also started recently. no evidence
   of coagulopathy at present.
   - no indication for 3 way foley.
   - maybe foley trauma related during recent admission.
   - follow conservatively for now.
   .
   #) Anemia:
   - mcv 90. will do anemia eval.
   - type and screen.
   .
   #) CRI:
   - at baseline.
   .
   #) DM:
   - outpatient lantus dose and sliding scale.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - ppi and pneumoboots.
   .
   #) Full code.
