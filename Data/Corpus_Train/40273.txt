Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2790-6-17**] 2:25 PM

CHEST TWO VIEWS ON [**6-17**]
FINDINGS: The right IJ line has been removed. There is dense
retrocardiac
opacification consistent with volume loss/infiltrate. There is
also small
left effusion, small right effusion. The upper lungs are clear.
Compared to the study from three days ago the lung aeration is
improved.

[**Hospital1 4**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  55% to 65%  >= 55%
Aorta - Ascending:  *4.9 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aortic Valve - LVOT diam:  2.2 cm
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Moderately dilated ascending
aorta Mildly dilated aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. No AS. Moderate to severe
(3+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
    N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated.
5. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 222**] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusion of nitroglycerine, AV pacing for slow SR
with 1 degree AV block. Pt placed on CPB x 3 for bleeding,
dehiscence of aortic valve. Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in
the aortic position. Trace AI. Trivial systolic gradient with
CO= 5 L/min. Small pericardial efusion. Aortic contour in the
descending arch is normal post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient is a same day admission, he was taken to the
Operating Room where a Bental procedure was performed. The valve
was indeed bicuspid. At the end of the case he had significant
bleeding from the right coronary button which required reopening
of the chest, the bleeding was then controlled surgically. he
required multiple blood products to correct a coagulopathy but
stabilized and was brought to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable
condition. He was relatively hypoxic post-operatively likely
from the volume of blood products he received. He was kept
sedated and aggressively diuresed over the next several days.
He awoke neurologically intact but cognitively slowed, he was
weaned from the ventilator and extubated on POD 3. He continued
to be diuresed, beta blockade was begun and he was seen by
Physical Therapy to assist with mobility and endurance.  He
remained in the ICU to monitor his pulmonary status. All tubes,
lines and drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocols.
On POD5 he transferred to the step down floor. Over the next
several days he worked with physical therapy and nursing to
improve his conditioning and allow his cognitive status to
improve. By POD8 he was ready for discharge home with a visiting
nurse. Followup in 1 week for wound check and 4 weeks with Dr
