Chief Complaint:  Hypoglycemia, hypotension and leukocytosis
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8839**] is a 66 yo M with Obesity hypoventilation syndrome, ?COPD,
   afib s/p cardioverson (not on coumadin), ESRD on HD (s/p failed renal
   tx, T,Th,Sa), PVD with recent admission for TMA ulcer s/p debridement
   who presents altered mental status in the setting of hypoglycemia.
   .
   In the ER his initial VS were: T 97.8   HR 81 irreg.  BP 108/72   RR
   18   O2 sat 96%
   .
   BG 30s in the nursing home, given glucagon IM x 2.  Transferred to the
   ER, BG upon arrival to the ER was 120.  In the ER he was normotensive
   but then began more obtunded and his BG was in the 30s and he was given
   D50 and his BG improved to 66 and was given 1 additional amp of D50.
   The patient has been intermittently hypotensive- with systolics between
   70-80.  His obtundation slightly improved with D50 but still with
   altered mental status.  L femoral line placed, 1L NS given, also given
   vanc / zosyn.  Some periumbilical abd pain so underwent CT abd / pelvis
   which was prelim negative, renal fellow contact[**Name (NI) **].   Cultures drawn
   from HD line.
   .
   Prior to his transfer to the floor his VS were: BP 105/59, 79  RR 12
   O2 100% on non rebreather.

   .
   CXR [**2571-7-11**]: New edema. Left upper lung opacity is difficult to assess
   due to low lung volumes and may represent asymmetric edema, though a
   focus of infection cannot be excluded. Reassessment following diuresis
   is recommended.
   [**2571-7-3**] TEE
   The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
   is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the
   body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
   descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild
   (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No
   vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No vegetation or intracardiac mass found. Mild aortic
   regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, ? COPD, afib, ESRD on HD, PVD
   with recent TMA ulcer, presents with confusion in the setting of
   hypoglycemia and hypotension with recent admission concering for
   infected HD catheter (early [**2571-7-1**]) which ws changed over a wire
   (growing out VRE) then new line sited. Now with concern for new source
   of sepsis
   > Hypotension /  Leukocytosis:  recent VRE HD line sepsis still on
   treatment with  Daptomycin. Will need to check peripheral and HD line
   cultures. His TMA is also a potneital souce although was OK on last
   admit. No obvious path on CT abd/pel and CXR is unchanged. Given hx
   would favor broad coverage (Pip-tazo and Daptomycin). No linezolid
   secondary to chronic low counts
   Also likely to have steroid deficiency with this new septic source.
   Will start stress: Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q 8
   - Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q 6
   - Daptomycin and Pip Tazo
   - F/u clx as above
   > Hypoxia: hx of COPD, may be hypercarbic in setting of sepsis and
   increased metabolic production of CO2. Will check ABG and utilize BiPAP
   if needed. Target SaO2 90-93%.
   > ESRD:  Clx off HD line and T, Th, Sat HD
   > Altered mental status:   likely secondary to hypoxia initially and to
   hypoglycemia for his second episode of altered mental status, also
   concern for hypercarbia.  Will correct these and w/u for leukocytosis.
   Also will discontinue digoxin.
   - check ABG
   - support for infection
   > Atrial fibrillation: Digoxin not indicated (although seemes to work),
   Will hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   > hypoglycemia: differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypothryoidism
   or adrenal insufficiency or insulinoma versus medication error /
   surreptitious insulin use.
   -send insulin level and c peptide level during hypoglycemia, confirm
   low BG on FS with serum glucose level
   -send TSH
   -a.m. cortisol(prob low yield in ths patient on chronic steroids (for
   chronic rejection)
   -w/u for leukocytosis as above.
   > PVD s/p TMA debridement: has wound vac.  Continue, possible source of
   infection.  s/p surgery on [**6-3**]. Has known peripheral vascular disease.
   Tissue culture without growth on culture. Was seen on [**6-14**] by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 7211**] with good granulation tissue
   - Cont VAC dressing
   - Wound care consult
   - Cont [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 350**]
   - Pain control cautiously with low dose morphine -> hold for now
