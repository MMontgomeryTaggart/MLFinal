defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 222**] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine briefly. AV pacing for
long pr interval. Preserved biventricular systolic function post
CPB. LVEF is now 60%. MR remains 1+. Aortic contour is normal
post decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 10511**] was a same day admit and on [**1-31**] she was brought
directly to the operating room and underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Beta
blockers and diuretics were started on post-op day one and she
was diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. On post-op
day one she was transferred to the step-down floor for further
care. She worked with physical therapy for strength and
mobility.  She was started on amiodarone for post-operative
atrial fibrillation, which resolved.  By post-operative day four
she was ready for discahrge to home.  All follow-up appointments
were advised.
