[**2912-4-15**] Echo: PREBYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The systolic BP was raised from
100 to 150 and the patient was placed in the tredelengerg
position and the MR remained mild.

POSTBYPASS: There is preserved biventricular systolic function.
The MR is now trace. The study is otherwise unchanged from the
prebypass study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10689**] was transferred from outside hospital after
cardiac cath revealed severe three vessel coronary artery
disease. Upon admission, he was medically managed and underwent
pre-operative work-up. He was brought to the operating room on
[**4-15**] where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 4.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one he had an episode of
hypotension and was started on Neo-Synephrine. His blood
pressure stabilized and was eventually started on beta-blockers.
On post-op day two his chest tubes were removed and diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day three his epicardial
pacing wires were removed and he was transferred to the
step-down floor for further care. During his post-op course he
worked with physical therapy for strength and mobility. He
continued to make good progress without complications and was
discharged home with VNA services on post-op day five.
Appropriate medications and follow-up appointments were made.
