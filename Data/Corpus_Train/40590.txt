[**6-5**] EKG: atrial fibrillation 91.  NA/QRS 110.  e/o LVH by
voltage criteria.  no ST or TW changes noted, poor baseline.  no
q waves.

[**6-5**] Echo: Biatrial enlargement. Normal left ventricular cavity
size with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy and mildly
depressed global left ventricular systolic function. Critical
aortic stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate
mitral regurgitation. At least moderate tricuspid regurgitation
in the setting of moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

[**6-5**]: CT chest: IMPRESSION:

1. Likely extravasation of IV contrast material into the sigmoid
colon from a colonic diverticulum, accounting for the patient's
bright red blood per rectum.

2. Concentric wall thickening within the distal descending colon
could relate to the stated history of a colonic mass.
Alternatively, this wall thickening could be the result of
normal peristalsis. Recommend correlation with the colonoscopy
report.

3. Slight wall thickening with intraluminal fluid involving the
rectum and distal sigmoid colon is most consistent with
proctocolitis.

4. Bibasilar septal thickening could be secondary to mild
pulmonary edema or mild fibrosis.

5. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

7. Small splenic hypodensities, too small to characterize.
Similarly,
multiple small bilateral renal lesions are too small to
characterize, although these lesions are likely simple cysts.

8. Marked atherosclerosis with moderate stenosis of the SMA
origin.

9. Enlarged right axillary lymph node, measuring 11 mm.

Clinical: Left colon.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh in two parts, each labeled
with the patient's name, "[**Known patient lastname 11164**], [**Known patient firstname 297**]" and the medical
record number.



Part 1 is additionally labeled "left colon, 2 stitches = splenic
flexure, one stitch = rectosigmoid, one long stitch = inferior
mesenteric pedicle".  It consists of a segment of colon that
measures 52 cm in length and up to 5.5 cm in diameter.  A
portion of mesentery is attached to the colon that measures 46.5
x 5.5 x 3.6 cm.  The surgeon has designated two stitches as the
splenic flexure, one stitch as the rectosigmoid, and a long
stitch designating the inferior mesenteric pedicle.  The
mesentery is unremarkable.  The serosa of the bowel is smooth
and unremarkable.  A palpable mass is present within the bowel.
The serosa overlying the mass is inked black.  The specimen is
opened along the antimesenteric surface to reveal a fungating
ulcerated mass within the lumen that measures 4 x 3 cm.  This
mass is located 21 cm from the splenic flexure surgical margin,
32 cm from the rectosigmoid surgical margin, and 6.5 cm from the
cut mesenteric margin.  Serial slices show that the tumor does
appear to invade the muscularis propria and mesentery and is 1.5
cm deep.  No perforation is present.  There is a tan mucosal
polyp measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, located 19 cm from the
rectosigmoid surgical margin.  Additionally, multiple
diverticula are present throughout the colon.  Two diverticula
with hypertrophical bowel wall adjacent to them are located 15
cm from the splenic flexure margin.  The remainder of the mucosa
is tan and unremarkable.  Within the mesentery, lymph nodes are
identified.  The specimen is represented as follows:  A = the
polyp which has been shaved from the mucosal surface, B-E =
representative sections of tumor (full thickness), with B and D
containing the deepest point of invasion, F = diverticula
located 15 cm from the splenic flexure surgical margin, G = two
additional representative diverticula, H = unremarkable bowel
wall, I = possible lymph nodes at the inferior mesenteric
pedicle, J = surgical margin at the splenic flexure, K =
surgical margin at the rectosigmoid, L-T = lymph nodes.
Part 2 is additionally labeled "inferior mesenteric artery
node." It consists of a lymph node and attached peri lymph node
fat measuring 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The lymph node is bisected and
entirely submitted in cassette U, along with the perilymph node
fat.

[**2504-6-12**] CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Free air is seen in a reasonable amount five days after
surgery.
2. Free peritoneal fluid is observed. While the largest pocket
is located in proximity to the anastomotic site; the absence of
air in this fluid and the fact that the fluid is low in density
make a leak less likely,
although this cannot be entirely excluded.

[**2504-6-17**] CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. No findings to suggest anastomotic leak. However, oral
contrast has not yet progressed to the colon, limiting
evaluation. If further evaluation is required, a delayed study
of the pelvis only could be performed.
2. Small amount of ascites, stable since the prior study.
3. Stable size of bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions.
4. Diffuse anasarca.

[**2504-6-18**] Bilat LE Ultrasound
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus in the right common femoral
vein entering from the right greater saphenous vein. Flow is
visualized throughout the left lower extremity.

[**2504-6-19**] KUB
IMPRESSION: In comparison to yesterday's abdominal x-ray, some
passage of
contrast. There are also dilated loops of bowel representative
of an ileus.

Brief Hospital Course:

MICU course:

88M transfer from OSH with history of atrial fibrillation
admitted with lower GI bleed requiring multiple blood
transfusions, found to have sigmoid mass concerning for
adenocarcinoma and new diagnosis severe AS.
.
# Lower GI Bleed - Hemorrhagic mass seen at OSH on colonoscopy,
not actively bleeding that appeared consistent with
adenocarcinoma (biopsies pending....).  Received multiple
transfusions at the OSH.  While in the MICU, me was transfused
as needed to maintain a hematocrit goal of 25 (given concerns
for heart stress related to his aortic stenosis).  Surgery and
cardiology were consulted, and the patient was sent for
valvuloplasty in order to prepare him for colon resection
.
# AS - presumed new diagnosis, critical.  His AS was felt to be
too severe to make him a good candidate for surgery, so the
decision was made for valvuloplasty followed by resection.  He
was asymptomatic while in the MICU under careful observation.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation - currently in atrial fibrillation on EKG.
 His Coumadin was held given concerns for GI bleeding, INR 1.4
on admission.  His rate was well controlled throughout admission
and he was monitored on telemetry.
.
# H/o CHF - patient exhibited no signs of volume overload while
admitted to the MICU.  His ACE-i and metoprolol were held given
GI bleed.

# Hypocalcemia - ionized Ca 0.66 on admission, likely due to
multiple transfusions at the outside hospital.  He received
calcium gluconate 4g with subsequent improvement. His levels
were closely monitored throughout admission, and were repleted
as necessary.

# Arthritis - Tylenol prn pain, remained stable throughout
admission.

________________________________________________________________
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11166**] care was transferred to the Acute Care team on
[**2504-6-6**] when he was taken urgently to the OR for left
hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis; biopsies were obtained
of the mass in his sigmoid. Postoperatively he was  returned to
[**Location 6672**] intubated, paralyzed, and on neo drip which was able to be
weaned off. He was extubated and noted with low UOP < 20 and was
given a 500 cc bolus. He was also noted with tachycardia and was
given extra metoprolol. Cardiology was consulted who recommended
diuresis and continuing beta blockade. Once stabilized he was
transferred to the regular floor.

Once on the floor bowel function was very slow to return. Over
the course of several days he was slowly advanced from sips to
clears and then to a regular diet.

On [**6-11**] he was noted with episode of unresponsiveness and
hypotension; there was concern for anastomosis leak. A CT scan
of his abdomen and pelvis was done and no leak was identified.

He subsequently was noted with several more trigger events over
the course of 3 days with hypotension, tachycardia and
desaturation. He required intermittent IV fluid bolus' with
normal saline for which he adequately responded. Following the
3rd trigger event there was concern again for anastomosis leak
and he underwent CT imaging of his abdomen which did not show
any leaking; it did however show a possible stricture at the
anastomosis. A KUB with contrast was ordered to determine if the
contrast went all the way through this area results revealed
some passage of contrast and dilated loops of bowel
representative of an ileus.

On [**6-15**] he was noted with a PLT drop down to 53 - his admission
plts were 123. His subcutaneous Heparin was stopped and a HIT
panel was sent which came back positive. Argatroban was started
and adjusted per his PTT.

Cardiology was re-consulted and his Lasix was recommended to be
stopped while continuing his beta blockade. He was also given
additional 250 ml NS fluid bolus following his Lasix being
stopped. Cardioversion was also being recommended but at the
time was being deferred as an outpatient. His Coumadin was also
recommended to be started with parameters for adjusting and
eventually stopping the Argatroban.
The Argatroban drip was eventually stopped and he was given 5mg
Coumadin; initial dose on [**6-19**] for several doses, his INR was
1.5 on [**6-23**]. Goal INR [**1-3**].

He was noted with hematuria on [**6-21**] requiring that a Foley be
replaced for irrigation and monitoring purposes - this did
resolve; his hematocrit remained stable with 30 being the last
value on [**6-23**]. The Foley was removed and he was able to void.

His hypotensive episodes did resolve and there were no more
trigger events. He was however noted with significant scrotal
edema and his LE edema had increased. Cardiology was
re-consulted and recommended Lasix 40 mg every other day; they
further noted that his albumin was likely contributing to his
edema as well.

Heme/Onc was consulted for follow up as an outpatient to discuss
with patient if treatment options indicated. The necessary CT
scans were already done prior as part of his workup and it was
requested to send a CEA as baseline.

Physical and Occupational therapy evaluations concluded that he
would require acute rehab after his hospital stay. The screening
process was initiated by case management.
