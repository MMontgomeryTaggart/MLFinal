   24 Hour Events:
   [**6-12**]:
   - s/p pleurocentesis by IP at 9am. 1500ccs drained.  RE: Pleurex
   Catheter, they would not place one at this time as they do not usually
   put in a permanent catheter in cases of heart failure but more as a
   last resort option
   - pressures low (SBP 75-85) most of the day, though patient
   asymptomatic and ambulating w/o difficulty. Received 500cc bolus
   overnight.
   - s/p fat pad biopsy by dermatology, s/p aspirate by gen [**Doctor First Name **], Sent for
   rush pathology.
   - spoke several times with amyloid clinic at [**Hospital1 470**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 6910**]). He has
   to be screened before appt can be made, then clinic happens
   monday-wednesday.  Clinic coordinator has CCU & patient phone numbers
   and should be calling in the next 1-2 days.
   - Patient's Cr increased from baseline, did not urinate from 4am to
   4pm, then put out 400 cc. Monitoring UOP.
   - Seen by heme-onc, rec: UPEP, beta2-microglob, troponin, skeletal
   survery, abd u/s, Factor X level.  They are awaiting a decision of
   goals of care and whether to treat here or at [**Hospital1 470**].
   - Seen by social work for coping/new diagnosis

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66 yo man with h/o amyloidosis who presents with
   hypotension in the setting of Lisinopril.
   .
   #. Amyloidosis:  The patient was recently diagnosed with amyloidosis on
   findings from TTE and Cardiac MRI.  Yesterday a fat pad biopsy and fat
   pad aspirate were done in search of a definitive tissue diagnosis.  The
   patient has yet to define clear goals of care and is awaiting
   acceptance into the BU Amyloid clinic.
    - Family meeting today to discuss diagnosis, prognosis and plan.
   Should involve primary team, heme/onc, social work, possibly palliative
   care.  Need to establish plan of care before discharge.
    - f/u fat pad biopsy, aspirate and UPEP
    - appreciate heme-onc recs.
    - If fat pad biopsy inconclusive, may require bone marrow biopsy.
   .
   #. Hypotension:  The patient's BP on admission was 74/51, and he was
   experiencing dizziness, nausea, and HA.  Initial symptomatic
   hypotension most likely due to Lisinopril.  Per the patient, his SBP
   normally runs in the 80s-90s, yesterday was able to ambulate with SBP
   in the high 70s and 80s.
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril and Lasix
    - Continue 500 cc NS fluid boluses as needed to maintain MAP > 60
    - If patient remains asymptomatic, no intervention necessary.
   .
   #. Pleural Effusions:  Thoracentesis done yesterday with symptomatic
   improvement per patient.  All effusions have been transudates, meaning
   cause is restrictive cardiomyopathy and will most likely recur.
   However, permanent cath would be last resort per IP.
    - Monitor dyspnea and morning CXR.
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure:  The patient's Cr on presentation is 1.9, which
   is increased from his baseline of 1.2 in [**4-20**], increased to 2.2 and now
   appears to be trending down.  Ddx is pre-renal due to hypotension vs
   amyloid renal disease.
    - FE Urea of 16 suggestive of pre-renal.
    - Continue to bolus with 500 cc NS as needed.
    - Continue to monitor Cr and UOP
   .
   #. FEN: Regular, Cardiac diet
   .
   #. ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   #. PROPHYLAXIS:
    - DVT ppx with Heparin SQ TID
    - Pain management with Tylenol prn
    - Bowel regimen with Colace and Senna
