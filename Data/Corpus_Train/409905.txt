Chief Complaint:  Chest pain
   HPI:
   The patient is a 53 yo man with h/o HTN and gout, who presented with
   acute onset chest pain.  The patient states that he was in his normal
   state of health until approximately 8 PM last night, when he developed
   acute onset chest pain in the setting of moving a mattress.  The
   patient states that the pain was [**8-28**], "pressure," located substernally
   and radiating to his left shoulder and back.  He had associated
   diaphoresis.  His wife, who was a RN in [**Country **], convinced him to come
   to the ED, where he presented at approximately  1:30 am.
   .
   In the ED, the patient's VS were T 97.9, BP 126/87, P 82, R 20, O2 97%
   on RA.  A Code STEMI was called, and the patient was taken emergently
   to the cath lab at 3 am.  He was given ASA 325 mg, O2, NTG SL, Plavix
   600 mg, Morphine, and he was started on a heparin gtt.
   .
   In the cath lab, the patient was found to have a 100% occlusion of the
   proximal LAD.  A thrombectomy was performed, and a DES was placed in
   the LAD.  He was then admitted to the CCU for further observation.
   .
   On arrival to the floor, the patient states that he is no longer
   experiencing chest pain.  He has stomach pain which began shortly after
   the procedure, but he states that this is markedly different from the
   pain which brought him into the hospital.
   .
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
   He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock
   or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
   exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 53 yo man with h/o HTN and
   hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain and was found to have an
   anterolateral STEMI, now s/p DES to the LAD.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  The patient presented with acute onset
   chest pain and associated diaphoresis in the setting of lifting a
   mattress.  He was found to have ST elevations in V2-V4, concerning for
   STEMI.  In the cath lab, he had a 100% occlusion and thrombus of the
   proximal LAD, now s/p thrombectomy and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1850**].  His CEs on
   admission were elevated (Troponin: 0.31 CK 755, MB 32, MBI 4.2)
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, SL NTG
    - Continue Integrilin gtt for total duration of 18 hours (until 9 PM)
    - Start Metoprolol 12.5 mg TID and uptitrate as tolerated
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin, given the patient's previous history
   of fatty liver [**2-20**] Tricor.
    - Start Captopril 6.25 mg TID and uptitrate as tolerated.  Consider
   restarting home dose of Diovan if BP improves this morning.
    - Change Prilosec to Ranitidine [**Hospital1 **]
