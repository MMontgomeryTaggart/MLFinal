History of Present Illness:
63 year old male with history of Henoch-Schonlein purpura and

ascending aorta on CT scan in [**2746-2-9**]. His aneurym came to
fruition when he had lost 30 pounds in the summer of [**2745**] in the
wake of his wife's passing. An abdominal CT suggested pulmonary
nodules and a dedicated chest CT was obtained in [**2746-2-9**]
which revealed the ascending aortic aneurysm. He was seen by Dr.

Given the size of his ascending aortic aneurysm (5.6cm), he was
referred for surgical consultation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient with Hx of htn who was incidently found to have dilated
ascending aorta on Ct scan [**2-/2746**] cardiac cath confirmed
findings and revealed 70% lesion of the lAD. The patient was
admitted to the hospital on day of surgery and brought to the
operating room on [**3-27**] where the patient underwent: aortic valve
replacement with a 29 mm [**Company 511**] Mosaic, replacement of
ascending aorta and hemiarch with a 28 mm
Dacron tube graft and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest,
coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with left internal mammary
artery to the first diagonal coronary artery and pericardial
reconstruction with CorMatrix product.
     Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well, see
operative report for further details. Of note, Mr.[**Known patient lastname **] had an
intraop anaphalactoid reaction during his platlet transfusion.
Post-operatively he was transferred to the CVICU intubated and
sedated. He continued to be hypotensive/post-op shock that
resolved with volume resuscitation and pressor support. POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  His
neo was weaned off slowly. Low dose Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed towards the preoperative
weight. He was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery on POD #2. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued per protocol, without complication. On POD#3 he
went into rapid a-fib and was started on Amiodarone. He
converted within 24hrs however had other transient episodes of
atrial fibrillation. He was placed on anticoagulation for
paroxysmal AF. It was arranged with his PCP's office for
Coumadin follow up. Electrophysiology was consulted due to a
conversion pause >4 seconds. Amio was discontinued and
beta-blocker remains. His Hct was low but was not signifcantly
symptomatic and the decision was made not to transfuse him, he
was started on Iron/Folate and multivitamin. The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #6 he
was ambulating freely. His wounds were healing well and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  He was discharged to home with
VNA services in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions advised.
