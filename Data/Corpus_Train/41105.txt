Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Heparin Agents / cefepime / vancomycin

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1187**]
Chief Complaint:
Hyopxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy placement [**12-21**]


History of Present Illness:
65-year-old male with a history of AAA repair with multiple
complications (operated in [**Month (only) 948**] by Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]),
including spinal ischemia with LE paralysis, bowel perforation
with colostomy, and right pleural effusion and perihepatic fluid
coming in with acute onset shortness of breath and hypoxia.
Patient developed acute onset of shortness of breath this
morning accompanied by pleuritic chest pain. No hemoptysis. No
history of blood clots, and he is on fondaparinox for
prophylaxis. He denies any fevers or chills.
.
The patient was admitted from [**10-31**] to [**11-6**] with a pleural
effusion and perihepatic fluid collection. He had a perihepatic
[**Month/Year (2) **] placed by IR, with cultures growing clostridium species,
and the decision was to treat him with cipro, metronidazole and
fluconazole until the [**Month/Year (2) **] was removed. He went to [**Hospital1 3481**]
rehab to continue the antibiotics.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 114 124/59 22 96%
non-rebreather. UA suggested an infection, so he was given
ciprofloxacin. A CTA chest showed no PE, but tracheal secretions
causing plugging and possible infection, so the patient got
ceftriaxone and metronidazole. Transplant surgery requested a CT
abd/pelvis to see if his [**Hospital1 **] could be removed. He got [**4-6**]
liters of fluid. He was requiring a lot of suctioning for oral
secretions, so he was triaged to the MICU instead of the floor.
Prior to transfer he had 18g and 22g PIVs, vitals were 76 128/48
26 satting 98% on 50% O2 moistened air.
.
On the floor, patient tachypneic and uncomfortable.
Intermittently hypoxic down to the low 80s, requiring increasing
amounts of oxygen. He has no feeling below T8, so does not know
if he has dysuria, but does note his foley was changed 3-4 days
ago. His ostomy output is unchanged. Other ROS negative.

Past Medical History:
- AAA repair ([**2-/3151**]) c/b T8 paraplegia, bowel perforation with
graft infection and bacteremia/fungemia (bacteriodes, strep
pneumo and [**Female First Name (un) 609**]). On chronic suppressive medications with
suppressive antibiotics with ciprofloxacin, Flagyl and
fluconazole.
- complete heart block, now status post pacemaker placement
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- COPD
- Osteoarthritis
- Increased PSA for which the patient underwent a biopsy prior
to [**3151-2-3**], which was complicated by an E. coli bacteremia
- s/p Trach for inability to clear secretions. Trach removed
about 3 weeks ago.

Social History:
Has 50 pack-year smoking history who stopped smoking prior to
his admission in [**Month (only) 948**]. He has a pet dog. He is married with a
very supportive wife and children. He works as a wine
distributor but is currently on disability and also retired a
year ago. Currently living at [**Hospital1 1085**] Rehabilitation
Center. No drugs or EtOH

Imaging:
[**3151-12-13**] AP Chest: FINDINGS: AP upright portable view of the
chest were obtained. No definite evidence of pneumothorax is
seen. There are right greater than left bibasilar opacities that
may be due to atelectasis, although consolidation is not
excluded. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angle suggests
trace bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes are stable. A single-lead right-sided pacemaker is
unchanged in position.

CTA chest: IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of secretions throughout the trachea and main
stem bronchi
with impaction of bronchi of the lower lobes and right middle
lobe. Increased atelectasis at both bases with small pleural
effusions. Given the elevated white blood cell count, there may
be a developing aspiration pneumonia, although the lower lobe
opacification is felt primarily due to atelectasis and volume
loss.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

CT Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Interval near complete resolution of subphrenic perihepatic
collection
with residual tiny foci of air noted within.
2. Unchanged appearance to aortic graft without evidence of
infection.
3. Left greater than right bibasilar atelectasis. Cannot exclude

superimposed aspiration.
4. Status post left colectomy with colostomy.
5. Large anterior abdominal wall defect as before.

[**3151-12-28**] AP CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of
[**12-26**], the monitoring and support devices remain in place. Areas
of opacification are seen at both bases, similar to the previous
study on the right and probably decreased on the left.
Although this most likely represents atelectasis and effusion,
the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be
considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

Brief Hospital Course:
65-year-old male with a history of AAA repair with multiple
complications (operated in [**Month (only) 948**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]), including
spinal ischemia with LE paralysis, bowel perforation with
colostomy, and right pleural effusion and perihepatic fluid
coming in with acute onset shortness of breath and hypoxia.
.
#. Secretions and hypoxia: Prior to admission, patient had had
increased secretions for the 3 days, exacerbating his chronic
difficulty clearing secretions. His tracheostomy had been
decannulated [**3151-11-23**]. The increase in secretions was likely the
result of infection, either bacterial or viral. He was afebrile,
but with an increased WBC count. Decision was made to cover
broadly with meropenem and linezolid for 10 days. He was treated
with maximal management of his secretions, including chest PT,
oral suctioning, adequate hydration, cough-assist device. He was
seen by speech and swallow, who felt that he did not have overt
aspiration. Blood and sputum cultures were all negative. Despite
treatment of a likely pneumonia, the patient continued to have
difficulty clearing his secretions. [**12-21**] the decision was made
to replace his tracheostomy tube, which was done by the
interventional pulmonary service without complications.
Afterwards, the patient continued to have hypoxia episodes
requiring intermittent mechanical ventilation. He required
frequent suctioning. Overall, his respiratory status slowly
improved, and by the time of discharge, he was requiring
suctioning every four hours, and was intermittently using the
Acapella cough assist device.
.
#. UTI: Patient had a positive UA on admission, and his culture
grew out enterobacter cloacae. His foley catheter was replaced.
He was initially treated with linezolid given a history of VRE,
but was covered with meropenem (along with his lung infection)
for 10 days.
.
# Perihepatic fluid collection: [**Month/Year (2) **] had minimal drainage. On
admission, CT abdomen and pelvis showed resolution of the
perihepatic fluid collection, so the [**Month/Year (2) **] was pulled. The
patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], his surgeon, in one
month.
.
# Chronic aortic graft infection: Patient was continued on
fluconazole throughout the admission. His ciprofloxacin and
metronidazole were held while on meropenem, and afterwards
restarted. He has follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **] clinic
[**1-31**].
.
#. Nutrition: in the setting of intermittent respiratory
distress, the patient was not getting adequate POs, so his tube
feeds were increased to 85ccs/hr cycling from 6pm to 10am.
However, after his respiratory status improved, he passed his
speech and swallow test and again was taking a diet during the
day. His tube feeds were put back to 70cc/hr from 10pm to 6am.
.
# Chronic pain: continued gabapentin.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure caring for you in the intensive care unit Mr.
[**Known patient lastname 9973**]. You were admitted with increased secretions, likely from
pneumonia. You were treated with 10 days of broad-spectrum
antibiotics. Because you continued to have frequent episodes
with low oxygen, your tracheostomy was replaced [**12-21**].
Your respiratory secretions have slowly improved and we think
you are ready to return to [**Hospital1 1085**] to work on getting
stronger.

While here you had your liver [**Hospital1 **] removed. You should follow
up with Dr.[**Name (NI) 7634**] office within the next three or four
weeks.

Some changes were made to your medications. Your antibiotics are
back at the doses for chronic suppression of your aortic graft
infection. Your blood pressures have been normal, so we did not
restart your lisinopril. You did not require hydroxyzine or
Ativan while you were in the Hospital. You were started on
chlorhexidine to help with care of your tracheostomy. You can
get albuterol and ipratropium to help with your breathing.
