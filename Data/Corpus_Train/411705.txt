Chief Complaint:  Respiratory failure, hypotension, acute elevation of
   cardiac biomarkers
   HPI:
   74 yo man with PMH significant for severe COPD on home O2, HTN
   initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 76**] on [**2574-7-29**] with dyspnea/respiratory
   distress. Patient called his neighbor, who called EMS. EMS found him in
   tripod position, talking in [**3-1**] word sentences, RR 35-40. He reported
   having dyspnea for 1-2 hours, but COPD flare for past few days. On
   arrival vitals were T 96, HR 179, BP 149/85, RR 30-40, O2 sat 94% on
   100% NRB. He had difficulty talking in sentences and was diaphoretic.
   He reported running out of his medications at home. He was immediately
   intubated and given nebs, solumedrol 125 mg, IVF, and Levaquin 750 mg.
   He was transferred to the ICU. While there, he was given 5-6 L IVF to
   support his BP. He was continued on COPD flare treatment. Patient
   developed elevated cardiac biomarkers and hypotension on [**7-30**], and
   transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] CCU was coordinated. Heparin gtt was started prior to
   transfer. Femoral line was placed in ICU prior to transfer.
   .
   On route by [**Location (un) **] ground transport, patient had SBP 76. Received
   500cc IVF and propofol was decreased from 30 to 10, however patient
   woke up and profolol was increased again. He was started on Levophed 5
   mcg/min, and SBP came up to 100. HR was in 90's. He also received
   albuterol nebs for wheezing, and Fentanyl 250 mcg. He remained on 100%
   O2, since sat dropped to 92% when O2 turned down to 70%.
   .
   Patient denies any chest pain, abd pain now. [**Month (only) 11**] have had chest pain at
   home. Rest of ROS deferred b/c intubated.

   EKG ([**2574-7-29**]) sinus tachy at rate 140, w/ PAB's
   [**2574-7-30**]: 1st degree AV block, rate 100, rightward axis, low voltages, Q
   waves in II, III, aVF (unchanged from prior), new 0.5 mm STe in I, avF,
   V4 and V5, and TwI in V4-V5, poor R wave progression.
   .
   CXR ([**2574-7-29**]): No cardiopulmonary abnormality. ET tube in place.
   [**2574-7-30**]: hyperinflated lungs, no e/o pulmonary edema/congestion, no
   cardiomegaly
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ PMHx HTN, COPD presents with respiratory failure, now
   transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 76**] with respiratory failure s/p intubation,
   NSTEMI, and hypotension requiring pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has no known cardiac history, risk factors
   include smoking and HTN. EKG shows 1st degree AV block, inferior Q
   waves and <1mm STD present since admission to OSH, with new TwI in
   lateral leads c/w ischemia/NSTEMI without meeting criteria for STEMI.
   Patient denies chest pain. Echo shows hypokinesis in all areas except
   for the base, and LVEF 30-35%, but not consistent with territory of EKG
   changes. Biomarkers elevated, CK at 626, continuing to rise, troponin
   peaked at 0.685 now trending down.
   - cont to trend CE to peak, repeat at midnight, 6 am
   - Plavix 600 mg load now and then 75 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - ASA 325 mg, start simvastatin 80 mg
   - hold beta-blocker, ACEi for hypotension
   - repeat EKG
   - cath lab if clinical deterioration
   .
   # PUMP:  Volume status appears euvolemic-hypovolemic, no crackles on
   exam, CXR WNL. [**Month (only) 11**] need continued hydration to support
   shock/vasodilation picture. No evidence of overload s/p 6L fluids.
   - f/u echo read
   - cont IVF boluses as needed, 500cc now and then as indicated by
   exam/CXR to avoid overload
   - daily CXR
   .
   # RHYTHM: 1st degree AV block, sinus.
   - Cont to monitor on tele
   .
   # Respiratory failure/COPD: Patient has severe COPD on home O2 (history
   unvalidated, per OSH notes), with hyperinflation on CXR and presenting
   symptoms very c/w COPD flare (tripod position, wheezing) and reported
   not taking meds at home. A-a gradient elevated at 124. No evidence of
   PNA on CXR, afebrile but is currently still on levaquin.
   - Remain intubated in setting of shock of unknown etiology, switch to
   Fentanyl/Versed for sedation
   - Follow ABGs
   - Cont therapy for COPD flare (nebs, Solumedrol, abx)
   - Consider discontinuing abx if no evidence of PNA
   - daily CXRs
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient developed hypotension in setting of presumed
   COPD flare and acutely elevated cardiac biomarkers. Patient maintained
   borderline adequate SBP's with aggressive IVF hydration of [**6-1**] L (per
   report, at OSH). Started on pressors during transport. However, patient
   was also on propofol which could not be weaned and may have contributed
   to hypotension.
   -In terms of shock etiologies, patient has warm, well-perfused
   extremities. No evidence of cardiogenic shock on exam or CXR.
   Hypovolemia may be a component of picture since COPD flare and
   decreased PO intake, but not likely the major etiology as patient was
   aggressivley hydrated without improvement. No hx suggestive of
   anaphylactic shock. Most likely is mixed picture including component of
   cardiogenic shock with vasodilatory state, such as septic shock, since
   patient is requiring high volumes of IVF and continues to be
   hypotensive. No obvious cause of sepsis, UA WNL, CXR clear.
   - wean Levophed as tolerated, with IVF boluses prn to maintain SBP>90
   and MAP>60.
   - A-line now to closely monitor hemodynamics
   - WBC 22 with left shift, but on high dose steroids, trend
   - f/u blood cx
   - monitor exam for localizing signs of infxn
   - consider central IJ line which would allow CVP monitoring, but has
   clean femoral line in place for now (placed afternoon [**7-30**])
   - trend lactate
   - switch propofol to Versed/Fentanyl
   - cont Levaquin day #2
   - to cath lab if clinical picture deteriorates
   .
   # Acid-base disturbance: Patient initially presented with ABG c/w
   respiratory acidosis. Now has mixed resp and metabolic acidosis,
   non-AG. Respiratory component due to acute on chronic CO2 retention in
   the setting of COPD. Non-gap metabolic acidosis most likely due to
   receiving large amount of IVF over 24 hrs.
   - serial ABGs
   - follow lytes, gap, consider using bicarb for fluids if patient
   remains with severe non gap metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Psych: Holding home Ativan and mirtazipine.
