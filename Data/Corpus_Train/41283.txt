Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was a same day admit and was brought directly to the
operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft x 3. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. POD 1 found the patient
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on
no inotropic or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight. Pain control was an issue and she was treated with
Toradol, Dilaudid and Tylenol, which  provided good relief. The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1336**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and said that it was
acceptable to stop Prasugrel. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
