TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  hypotension
   HPI:
   Please see medicine admit note from [**2964-8-26**] for full details and H&P.
   Briefly, 63 yo female with ETOH cirrhosis on the transplant list who
   was just discharged recently from the Hepatorenal service with noted
   acute kidney injury that had resolved.  Over the last 2 days, she has
   made minimal amounts urine, and called her hepatologist who had her
   direct admitted to [**Wardname **].  Upon arrival, the patient was noted to have
   SBPs in the low 80s, lowest BP [**Location (un) **] was 72/42.  Despite 2 liters of
   saline, she was still 78/46.  The patient's creatinine was noted to be
   4.0, and hyperkalemic with K of 5.5 without ECG changes.  Kayexalate
   was also given prior to transfer.  Of note, patient's INR is 2.7.  Type
   and cross was ordered prior to transfer.
   Patient denies chest pain, fevers, chills.  She does report some
   dyspnea, but states it is more from her distended abdomen.  She denies
   any nausea or vomiting at this time.  She has no other complaints.
   Of note, she had a rxn to heparin vs midodrine with full body skin rash
   on last hospitalization

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 63 yo F w/ h/o EtOH cirrhosis and recent discharge [**2964-8-18**] with
   [**Last Name (un) **] which improved concerning for hepatorenal sx vs prerenal azotemia
   who was direct admitted for decreased urine output now noted to be
   persistently hypotensive
   # Hypotension- possibly causes include dehydration, metabolic
   disturbance/electrolytes, sepsis, severe cirrhosis. Pt with low temp,
   no WBC. CXR without obvious PNA
   - 2 large IVs in place now; will hold off on CVL with INR 2.7; needs
   FFP and vitamin K prior to central access
   - can consider peripheral dopa if necessary to keep MAP>60
   - no UOP for now; but that was present prior to arrival
   - albumin being given for volume and ? HRS
   -f/u final read CXR
   -f/u U/a, urine culture, blood culture
   - consider diagnostic para, but first will need FFP
   - hold off on abx for now
   # [**Name (NI) 8570**] unclear etiology at this time. possible causes include prerenal
   given hypotension and renal failure, possible HRS, possible AIN given
   desquamating rash during last hospitalization
   - bolus fluids as above, then to give albumin 50gm
   - f/u U/A and urine lytes sent
   - check urine eos
   - renal ultrasound
   - kayexalate for hyperkalemia; recheck K in a few hrs
   # ETOH cirrhosis- gets therapeutic para weekly. Bili up at 18 from 17
   on discharge. Meld 42 here.
   - consider therapeutic/ diagnostic paracentesis this morning (will need
   FFP first)
   - continue home lactulose, folate, thiamine, vitamin K, ursodiol,
   rifaximine, omeprazole, cipro for SBP prophylaxis
   - holding nadolol given hypotension
   # FEN: IVF boluses as above, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: 2 peripherals; hold off on CVL until after reversal
   # Code: full
   # Communication: Patient
   # Disposition: pending above

   MICU ATTENDING ADMISSION NOTE
   Critical Care:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known patient lastname 5471**] presents with acute renal failure after recent admission
   to [**Hospital1 17**] almost a week ago. She had developed a diffuse rash which is
   now scaling and not as pruritic as before. She has noted oliguria over
   past 48 hrs. I suspect the combination of capillary leak, hypotension
   and poor PO intake in addition to continued medication use had
   contributed to this ( ATN vs HRS vs AIN)
   She is deeply jaundiced and has a diffuse exanthema in various stages
   of healing and scaling. She has obvious tachypnea on account of her
   ascites and mild anasarca. Her urine output remains marginal but creat
   has decreased to 3.8 ( from 4). Her SBP is low and in the 70-90 mmhg
   range.
   Hct is 25.1, creat of 3.8, HCO3 of 19, PO4 of 5.8 and INR of 3.1
   She will need PICC line placement for product support and IVF
   slowly). She may need IV neosynephrine to help with MAP and GFR in
   addition to IV albumin. There does not appear to be an obvious septic
   source at this time and we will hold off on antibiotics unless
   hepatology staff prefer otherwise. She will likely need paracentesis if
   hemodynamics are better and can tolerate this in am [**2964-8-27**]. Renal
   service has also seen today and will await recs from them.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
