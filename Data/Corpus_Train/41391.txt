Pertinent Results:
[**3102-1-2**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
A mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta, arch,
descending thoracic aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. The Flap was seen close to the RCA origin RV
systolic function was intact.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on Mr.
[**Known patient lastname 13521**] before surgical incision..

POST-BYPASS:

Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
Trivial MR.
Mild AI.
The ascending aorta and arch are intact.

[**3102-1-2**] CTA
1. Type A aortic dissection extending from the aortic root
distally into the proximal right external iliac artery.
Dissection also extends into the left subclavian artery.

2. Right renal artery arises from the false lumen with poor
enhancement of
the right kidney, concerning for hypoperfusion.

3. 3.9-cm rounded area in the interpolar region of the right
kidney
(Se300;Im33) which while may represent a very prominent column
of Bertin, a renal mass may be present, not well evaluated on
this study. Further
evaluation is recommended with ultrasound when the patient is
clinically
stable.

These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in person at 11:40 a.m. on [**3102-1-2**]. Updated findings
and recommendation under #3, regarding right renal findings,
were submitted to the radiology critical findings dashboard on
[**3102-1-2**].

[**3102-1-3**] Renal U/S
1. No evidence in the main renal artery within the hilum of the
kidney
bilaterally to suggest renal artery stenosis. Ultrasound is
unable to
visualize the renal artery from the origin to the hilum of the
kidney. The
artery is only visible within the renal hilum.
2. Solid right renal mass which could represent an
angiomyolipoma vs
hyperechoic renal cell carcinoma. Further characterization is
suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 13521**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 4**] on [**3102-1-2**] for surgical
management of his type A dissection. He was taken directly to
the operating room where he underwent repair of his type A
dissection. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He was transfused with blood and blood products for
postoperative bleeding and anemia. As his right kidney was
perfused by the false lumen and no flow was noted, the urology
service was consulted. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per
protocol.His creatinine was noted to elevate and he was seen by
renal service and will follow up with them as an outpt. Further
eval revealed a right renal mass that requires evaluation by an
outpt. urologist. He went into A Fib and was treated with
amiodarone with conversion to SR. He continued to make good
progress and was cleared for discharge to [**Hospital3 2026**] in
[**Location (un) **] on POD #11.  All f/u appts were advised.
**Requires further w/u of renal mass by a urologist as an outpt.
