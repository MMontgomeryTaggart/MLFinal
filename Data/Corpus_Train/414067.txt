Chief Complaint:  Reason for ICU admission: GI Bleed
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 5471**] is a 63 female with alcoholic cirrhosis, who was initially
   admitted for acute renal failure 9 days ago.  She was briefly in the
   MICU after she triggered for arrival for hypotension thought to be due
   to hypovolemia.  She was given albumin and IVF and her BP improved.
   .
   On the floor, her ARF improved; Her Cr went down from 4.0 to 1.2 (still
   up from baseline of 0.8 - 1) with IVF and holding diuretics.
   Additionally, she developed a drug rash ?secondary to midodrine.  He is
   also being work up to put on the liver transplant, including a right
   heart cath which showed pulmonary HTN.
   .
   On the day of transfer, she had three black/marroon colored stools.
   She was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs and then 3 units of FFP and her Hct
   went from 22.3 --> 19.6.  She was started on Octreotide drip and IV PPI
   [**Hospital1 7**].  Of note, patient has a history of grade two esophageal varices
   and an 8 cm antral ulcer.

   STUDIES:
   [**2964-8-31**].
   Right heart cath.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
   2. Pulmonary artery hypertension
   .
   Echo. [**2964-8-29**].
   IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate to severe
   tricuspid regurgitation. Likey patent foramen ovale/atrial septal
   defect. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2964-6-15**], the
   severity of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated PA systolic
   pressure are higher. A PFO/ASD is now suggested.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 5471**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2964-8-26**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now trasnferred to MICU for GIB.
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   Her symptoms are consistent with either upper GIB or right sided lower
   bleed.  She remains hemodynamically stable.
   - IV octreotide for therapy of esophageal variceal bleed
   - IVV PPI
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - FFP to keep INR < 2
   - EGD today
   - q 4-6 hour Hcts
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, consider cordis if
   needed
   - type and cross 4 units
   - hold nadolol for now
   - NPO for now
   .
   2. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3560**].
   No need for para today.  MELD today is 28 today, but was recently 42.
   Currently undergoing liver transplant eval and hopes to be put on the
   list in the upcoming days.
   - hold nadolol
   - continue lactulose & rifaximin
   - ?ceftriaxone for SBP ppx in settin gof GI bleed
   - continue vitamin K daily
   - hold diuretics
   .
   3.  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 1.2 today with albumin and
   holding diuretics.  There was concern for AIN secondary to ?midodrine
   versus cipro.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   - blood transfusions for colloid rather than albumin
   .
   4.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   5.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   6.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  Though
   there is concern for possible DVT, could not get anticoagulated given
   elevated INR and GIB.
   - RLE LENI
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, NPO tonight
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .
   Access: right PICC, 2 20s

   Code: full, confirmed with patient, ICU consent signed
