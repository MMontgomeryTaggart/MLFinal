   Assessment and Plan
   43yo male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with severe dilated nonischemic
   cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid
   obesity with weight in excess of 415 lbs., s/p BiV/ICD with LBBB, OSA
   who was directly admitted to CCU for decompensated systolic CHF
   requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: EF 15% during last ECHO in
   [**2-27**] thought to be nonischemic cardiac myopathy. Continues diuresis at
   approx. 6-7 L daily, goal will be to maximize diuresis.
   - Continue Milrinone 0.5mcg/kg/min infusion and neosynephrine 0.5
   mcg/kg/min infusion; will tolerate MAP > 55.  Will try to wean him off
   neosynephrine as BP tolerates.
   - Continue IV lasix gtt at 30 mg/hr
   - Continue Metolazone 5mg PO BID
   - Increase spironolactone at 50 daily
   - continue metoprolol at 100mg PO TID
   - hold lisinopril at this time
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Chem 7s.
   - Replete Potassium- 40 meq IV TID.
   .
   # RHYTHM: with biV/ICD. Continues with freguent non- sustained episodes
   of VT.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Metoprolol 100mg PO TID
   - Amio bolus and gtt in case of sustained VT
   .
   # Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Secondary to poor cardiac output. Crt
   on admission 1.5 up to 1.7 today.
   - Continue to hold lisinopril at this time
   - Monitor Creatinine
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD, no cath in past
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Gout: Flare in left foot.
   - continue colchicine q 6 hours with tylenol
   .
   # OSA
   - not on bipap at home
