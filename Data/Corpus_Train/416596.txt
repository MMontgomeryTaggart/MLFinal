TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  shortness of breath, somnolence
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 8261**] is an 82 year old female with MDS, Crohn's disease, CAD s/p
   NSTEMI, CRI, h/o DVT with saddle embolus on weekly lovenox due to h/o
   GIBs, h/o breast cancer, on home O2 who presents with dyspnea, AMS. Of
   note, patient was discharged 6 days ago with left upper extremity DVT
   from PICC and subsequent port placement.
   In ED, patient presented somnolent with marked tachypnea from
   ambulance. ABG 7.21/80/76 given baseline pCO2 60 patient was started on
   BiPAP. CXR with effusions, but unclear if any consolidation. Mildly
   positive UA, minimal urine output. Patient was started on Vanc/Zosyn
   and given methylpred 125mg empirically. Patient with troponin at
   baseline. K noted to be 7.0: 60 gm kayexelate enema (with no
   significant bowel movement), amp D50, 10 unit insulin iv,
   albuterol/ipratropium nebs, and 1 gm calcium gluconate. EKG no peaked
   Ts, QRS 130 which is baseline and no other concerning ST/T changes.
   Patient repeat K pending. Renal aware of K+ but given EKG felt no need
   for urgent HD. Given recent left upper extremity DVT, patient got 60 mg
   lovenox in ED as has not gotten today. Unable to get PE CTA given renal
   failure. Minimal improvement on BiPAP in terms of mental status.
   Current vitals: temp afebrile by rectal, BP 140/40s, HR 50s, O2sat 97%
   on bipap 8/5, 2LNC.
   Event prior to transfer: SBP 70s suddenly, and SBP improved 100s off
   BiPAP, still sinus brady. Patient slightly more awake now off BiPAP,
   getting 500 ml bolus. ABG just prior 7.27/68/74.
   Upon arrival to MICU, patient somnolent off BiPAP. Patient placed back
   on BiPAP and want unable to answer questions. Daughter provided the
   following history. Daughter reports since discharge from hospital
   patient has been weak, not interested in eating, and intermittently
   very somnolent. Daughter reports her mother is [**Name2 (NI) 4615**] and then not
   confused. [**Name2 (NI) 7930**] describes 2 episodes of confusion this week in the
   setting of document hypoxia to 70s, that resolved upon increasing
   oxygen. Daughter reports mother [**Name (NI) 9642**] hot w/o fever by thermometer, and
   w/o chills. Over the week the daughter has noted she issues with
   oxygenation and has changed her O2 between 1.5 to 3LNC. Usually her
   mother is only on O2 at night, but has been on it continuously since
   just prior to last hospitalization. Daughter has been giving her
   Bactrim and vitamins to help. She also gave her mother [**Doctor Last Name 1730**]
   yesterday, because she wanted her to retain water and was concerned she
   was becoming dehydrated. Daughter reports increased UOP earlier in the
   week followed by minimal urine output today. Early on day of admission
   patient called out to daughter and reports not seeing well and wanting
   to get out of bed. Per daughter, these are symptoms of hypercarbia in
   her mother. Daughter also report mother has had non-productive cough,
   but without coughing after eating. Per daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] check was K
   =5.3 from VNA labs.

   1. Nearly occlusive thrombus in the left axillary vein.
   2. Large 10 x 2.5 x 3 bilobed hematoma in the left arm.
   UE U/S [**2830-7-8**]: 1. Deep vein thrombosis again seen in the left axillary
   vein, and today it is identified in one of the two brachial veins. No
   thrombus is identified within the left subclavian or left IJ veins. 2.
   Stable-appearing left upper arm hematoma.
   ECHO [**2830-2-26**]: Mild LVH. LV EF > 75%. RV dilated with normal free wall
   contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. 2+ TR, moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler
   study suggests probably normal diastolic function.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with MDS, Crohn's disease, CAD s/p NSTEMI, CRI, h/o
   DVT with saddle embolus on weekly lovenox due to h/o GIBs, h/o breast
   cancer, on home O2 who presents with dyspnea, somnulence.
   # Dyspnea: CXR w/ concern for retrocardiac opacity most c/w PNA. h/o PE
   and recent upper extremity DVT, unable to get CTA. Concern for
   heparinization due to hx massive GI bleed w/ heparin. Also with hx
   diastolic heart failure although last ECHO just hyperdynamic w/ right
   heart strain and dry on exam.
   -- ECHO for RV strain
   -- Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for PNA given recent hospitalization,
   immunocompromized
   -- sputum, urine, blood cultures
   -- anticoagulation with lovenox 60 mg daily
   -- stress dose steroids, given home pred 20 mg daily
   -- gentle IVFs
   # Somnolence: unable to determine if also underlying confusion given
   current mental status. likely due to hypercarbia. Baseline bicarb on
   chemistries is 28-30, so CO2 likely in 40s.
   -- cont BiPAP
   -- O2 goal > 88%
   -- Monitor CO2
   # Hyperkalemia. Concern for med effect, and poor nutrition/
   dehydration.  Prior episode during last admission felt to be due to
   blood resorbtion from her hematoma. CK 16. Patient got Ca gluconate in
   ED.
   -- recheck K 6.8, repeat Kayexalate
   -- hold bactrim
   -- serial EKGs
   -- CEs *3
   -- repeat LUE U/S to assess clot
   # PICC associated left upper extremity DVT and hematoma [**3-28**]
   -- cont lovenox, monitor HCT as below
   # MDS dx 3 yrs ago, transfusion dependent
   -- cont folic acid
   -- HOLD bactrim for ppx as can cause hyperkalemia
   -- c/s heme/onc and/or ID on alter ppx given likely bactrim is reason
   for intermittent hyperkalemia
   # Crohn's disease:
   -- cont mesalamine (does not have listed SE of hyperkalemia)
   -- stress dose steroids as above
   # CAD s/p NSTEMI
   -- not on ASA due GI bleed
   -- unclear why not on statin last LDL in [**2825**] was 116, will discuss
   restarting once acute illness has resolved.
   -- on BB PRN will discuss restarting continuously once acute illness
   has resolved
   # Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: hyperdynamic by ECHO, on
   exam patient is dry.
   -- hold lasix
   # Chronic b/l LE edema/Chronic Venous Stasis
   -- cont triamcinolone cream
   -- feel intravascularly euvolemic, so hold lasix in this acute setting
   -- c/s wound

   -- cont omeprazole as protonix IV
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Cr 1.9 recovering from acute renal failure,

   -- continue EPO
   # Anemia: chronic attributed to CKD, chronic disease, MDS

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   outstanding note above by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5050**], including the assessment and
   plan. I would emphasize and add the following points: 82F complex PMH
   notable for chronic hypercarbic respiratory insufficiency, DVT/PE, MDS,
   IBD / Crohn's disease, CRI, episodic hyperkalemia now admitted with
   somnolence, hyperkalemia and ABG 7.21/80/76.
   Exam notable for Tm 95.8 BP 120/50 (transient drop on NPPV to 80/40) HR
   63 RR 23 with sat 90 on CPAP 10. Frail woman, intermittent moaning.
   Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 1+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 6K, HCT
   27, K+ 7.0, Cr 1.9, lactate 0.5. CXR with B effusions, retrocardiac
   opacity; EKG c long PR, NSSTTW changes.
   Agree with plan to manage recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure
   with NPPV (CPAP 10 for now), serial ABGs (OK to place art line per
   daughter), and broad abx coverage with vanco / zosyn / cipro while
   awaiting culture data. Will place on stress steroids given chronic
   prednisone and hypotension. PE is difficult to exclude given her known
   clots and ARF. Will continue home lovenox and check echo in AM re R
   heart function, but will hold off on IV heparin given IBD with bleeding
   complications in the past. Hyperkalemia in the setting of worsening ARF
   may be due to bactrim, which has been given on a daily basis. Will hold
   for now and continue kayexalate PR; renal aware but no immediate plans
   for HD given lack of EKG changes. For ARF, will check lytes, [**Street Address(1) 9643**]
   meds while gently hydration overnight. Access is via portacath, pt is
   DNR/I, above d/w daughter at bedside by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5050**]. Remainder of
   plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
