   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9699**] is a 71 year old male with ESRD on HD, PVD, CAD s/p NSTEMI,
   here with altered mental status and sepsis requiring pressors likely
   secondary to osteo of right foot, although line infection or other
   sites of osteo cannot be excluded.  Plan to become CMO today after
   arrival of family members.
   .
   Goals of care.  Family meeting yesterday to make patient DNR/ DNI with
   no escalation of care.  Plan to make patient CMO today after his family
   members arrive.
   .
   Sepsis.  Hypotension likely secondary to sepsis given that patient has
   elevated WBC and large amounts of necrotic tissue on both feet and
   hands.  Suspect that right foot osteo is the source, but may also be
   secondary to bacterial seeding from skin breakdown, line infection (has
   tunnelled HD line), or other occult source.  No clear source of
   pneumonia.  Given low voltages, will get echo to evaluate for effusion
   (though echo today at OSH did not show temponade).  Also, echo can be
   obtained to look for endocarditis.
   - follow up blood cultures, UA, UCx
   - f/u final read of foot and hand films to evaluate for osteo
   - vascular following but do not feel foot is the source
   - vanco/zosyn/cipro for double gram negative coverage in setting of
   diabetic foot osteo and GPC for dialysis patient with tunelled HD line
   - echo to evaluate EF and look for endocarditis
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Levophed to maintain MAPS> 60, consider starting vasopressin if this
   causes significant tachycardia
   - obtain OSH records of micro data
   .
   Gangrenous foot and digits/ PVD.  Patient has b/l gangrenous toes and
   toe stumps which have significantly worsened over the last year. In
   [**11-12**], he was noted to have "a 2-cm ulceration over the site of the
   fifth digit TMA [on the left foot]."  Vascular evaluated the patient,
   but do not feel that he needs urgent amputation.  Foot films
   demonstrated osteo worst at the right foot.  He is likely not a
   surgical candidate given his recent NSTEMIs and was declined for
   revascularization.
   - vascular consult for management of gangrenous extremities
   - ABIs per vascular
   - vanco/zosyn/cipro to cover infection
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - morphine PRN foot pain
   .
   Altered mental status.  Even with vietnamese translator, patient was
   confused, although has had some improvement of mental status throughout
   the night.  Likely delerium in the setting of hypotension and
   infection.  OVerall seems to be improving.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - continue IVFs and pressors to maintain MAPs> 60
   - limit sedating meds, but will resume seroquel given agitation
   - will continue morphine in spite of sedating effects given the degree
   of his pain
   - consider head CT if no improvement of mental status over 24 hours
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient presented with hypoglycemia at OSH but was
   hyperglycemic on arrival.  Had episodes of hypoglycemia overnight on
   insulin drip so transistion to ISS.
   - HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   End stage renal disease on HD.  Likely secondary to diabetic
   nephropathy.  Has hyperphosphatemia.  No urgent dialysis needs.
   - will notify renal of his arrival, patient typically gets HD MWF but
   at this point would need CVVH given hypotension requiring pressors
   - initiate phos binders when eating
   .
   Hypertension.
   - hold antihypertensives in setting of hypotension requiring pressors
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease.  Patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy and
   significantly reduced EF over the course of 1 year.  Was told that he
   needed revascularization but was not felt to be a cath candidate.
   - continue aspirin and statin
   - hold BB
   .
   Depression.
   - continue seroquel, celexa
   .
   H/o A.fib with RVR.
   - hold coumadin in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   - follow INR
   .
