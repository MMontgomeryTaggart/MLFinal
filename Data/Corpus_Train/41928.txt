Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and chest tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84M year old male with past medical history of COPD, CAD s/p MI,
HTN, HL and recent hospitalization for bronchitis who presents
with shortness of breath and "burning" chest tightness. Pt
reported 2 weeks of chest discomfort, productive cough, +SOB and
chills in the ED but tells this interviewer that the tightness
has been going on for months. He denies cough or chills but
endorses shortness of breath that is worse with lying down and
improved when standing up. He notes that food makes him feel
better. He also notes that his inhalers he uses at home have not
been helping. Pt is poor historian, difficult to elicit
specifics of chest pain. Denies fevers, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, leg swelling. Not on home O2. Reports recent
fall that he attributes to "dizziness" he gets when he gets out
of bed. Lives at home but says he was hospitalized 1 month ago
for bronchitis. Pt reports he was supposed to go to the [**Location 7252**] VA this morning for an appointment (with what looks like
to have been for an ECHO based on paperwork he has), but when he
went there with his current symptoms they sent him here. In the
ED, he reported that he went to the wrong VA because apparently
the ER moved after he was there last.

In [**Hospital1 4**] ED VS were T 98.2, BP 121/77, P 90, R 16, O2 sat 97.
Labs were remarkable for negative troponin. EKG was not
concerning for a STEMI. Pt was given 1L NS. He was also given
levofloxacin and vancomycin out of concern for pneumonia based
on retrocardiac opacity from a wet read of chest x-ray. Vitals
on transfer were 122/34, 88, 23, 98% 3L.

On arrival to the floor, vitals were T 96.0, BP 130/70, P 88,
18, O2 100 3L NC. Pt states he feels much improved. Currently
feeling well, but describes a feeling of chest tightness that he
attributes to [**Hospital1 15153**].

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.

Past Medical History:
HTN
COPD not on home O2
CHF, EF 20-25% [**9-/3250**]
CAD s/p large MI in [**3216**]
BPH

step-daughter's husband. Retired post office worker of 33 years.
Remote smoking history 50 years ago. Denies alcohol use or drug
use.

Family History:

MICROBIOLOGY
[**3251-10-3**] Blood cultures x2: NGTD
[**3251-10-3**] MRSA SCREEN (Final [**3251-10-6**]): No MRSA isolated.

IMAGING
[**3251-10-3**] 7:06 AM EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Left atrial
abnormality. Q waves in leads V1-V4 with ST segment elevation in
those leads. Q waves in leads I and aVL. No previous tracing
available for comparison. Tracing is consistent with an
anteroseptal infarction of undetermined age.

[**3251-10-3**] ECHO (EF 15-20%) The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
and apical anteroseptal, anterior and lateral wall
hypokinesis/akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened without significant stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe
regional LV systolic dysfunction in the distribution of the
proximal LAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild
aortic regurgitation.

[**3251-10-3**] CHEST (PA & LAT): PA and lateral views of the chest
were provided. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
There is evidence of mild pulmonary edema as demonstrated by
prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and Kerley B lines. The
heart size is enlarged. There are small bilateral pleural
effusions as well as small amount of fluid within the right
minor fissure. Surgical clips are seen in the right upper
quadrant likely from prior cholecystectomy.

[**3251-10-3**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Widespread relatively symmetric
basal predominant heterogeneous pulmonary opacification is most
likely worsening moderate to severe pulmonary edema. Heart is
only moderately enlarged. Left pleural calcifications should not
be mistaken for lung nodules, but given the extensive pleural
and parenchymal abnormalities, significant lung lesions could be
missed. Presence of central adenopathy cannot be assessed.

[**3251-10-4**] 6:57 AM EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Compared to tracing
#1 there is no diagnostic interval change. The tracing continues
to show Q waves in leads V1-V4 consistent with a prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction of undetermined age.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M w/ PMH HTN, HL, CAD s/p MI who initially p/w shortness
of breath and chest tightness, sent to CCU for flash pulmonary
edema in the setting of hypertension likely secondary to
paroxysmal cough, and thought to have COPD exacerbation, on
azithromycin, though with an element of CHF exacerbation.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Flash Pulmonary Edema - Pt was transferred to the CCU after
experiencing [**8-5**] chest tightness, dyspnea with desaturation to
the 70's, hypertension, and diaphoresis with concern for EKG
changes, consistent with ischemia and worsening pulmonary edema
on chest xray. This episode occurred shortly after he was
admitted to the regular medicine floor. It occurred acutely,
likely secondary to increased left ventricular strain
precipitated by paroxysmal coughing (after having taken his
medications in applesauce and coughing quite a bit from this) in
the setting of an already low ejection fraction (see below).
Prior to transfer he was given morphine, sublingual
nitroglycerin, IV lasix 40mg x 1 and started on a nitroglycerin
drip. Upon reaching the unit his breathing had significantly
improved with oxygen saturations in the high 90's on 4L nasal
cannula and he put out well with IV lasix. He had elevated, but
non-diagnostic troponin and CK-MB after this event, likely due
to increased demand in the setting of left ventricular strain.
On review of his EKG's, he was found to have significant old Q
waves, poor R-wave progression, and repolarization changes but
not acute changes concerning for ischemia. After he stabilized
he was sent to the regular medicine floors. He was euvolemic and
had good oxygen saturations on room air, even while ambulating.

# Questionable COPD Exacerbation - There was concern for COPD
exacerbation given his cough, chest tightness and sweats prior
to admission, though he was without significant wheezing on lung
exam. He was initially started on azithromycin and prednisone
while in the CCU, given the thought of possible COPD
exacerbation. Upon admission, there was consideration of a
retrocardiac opacity. Therefore, the azithromycin was continued
for a total 5-day course, but his prednisone was discontinued
because it was felt that it was not needed.

# Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: ECHO was performed,
which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LEVF) of
15-20% on [**3251-10-3**] and based on [**Location 58**] VA records, ECHO
from one year ago showed an LEVF of 25-30%. Pt was continued on
his home lisinopril and metoprolol. Spironolactone was added on
to complete his heart failure medication regimen, given his low
ejection fraction.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# CAD s/p MI: Pt was continued on his home aspirin and
rosuvastatin.

# Hypertension - Pt was continued on his home metoprolol,
isosorbide, and lisinopril.

# Hyperlipidemia - Pt was continued on his home rosuvastatin.

# [**Location **]/[**Name (NI) 15154**] Neuralgia - Pt was continued on his
home lidocaine patch and gabapentin.

# Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease - Pt was continued on his
home omeprazole.

# Benign Prostatic [**Name (NI) 15155**] Pt was continued on his home
tamsulosin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Patient's cardiology records should be reviewed with the
possibility of starting the patient on a lasix regimen should he
need it.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known patient lastname 15156**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay
at [**Hospital1 509**]. You were admitted
because of your shortness of breath and chest tightness. It is
possible that your shortness of breath was caused by an
exacerbation of your COPD. This exacerbation can be caused by an
infection of the lungs, known as pneumonia. Your chest xray had
a possible pneumonia. For this reason, we started you on an
antibiotic, Azithromycin, for a total of 5 days. Your shortness
of breath may also have been caused by extra fluid in your
lungs, caused by the decreased pumping function of your heart
(see below). You started to feel better when we gave you lasix,
a water pill, that helped take the extra fluid off.

During your admission, you had a period of severe coughing that
increased your blood pressures, and in the setting of decreased
pumping function of the heart, you ended up with fluid around
your lungs that made your breathing even more difficult. You
were given lasix, a water pill, to get the extra fluid out, and
you were transfered to the Coronary Care Unit for further care.
When an ultrasound of your heart was performed, it was found
that your heart is not pumping as well as it should, and so you
were started on a new medication, Spironolactone. After you
improved, you were transfered back to the regular floor. You
were feeling better on the antibiotics and you no longer needed
extra oxygen. It was felt that it was safe for you to go home.

With regards to your medication, please make the following
changes.
Please START taking:
1. Azithromycin - an antibiotic for your COPD exacerbation
(5-day course, last dose on [**10-8**])
2. Spironolactone - because of your heart's decreased pumping
function

Please continue to take your other home medications as
prescribed in your discharge paperwork.

Followup Instructions:
Name: [**Last Name (LF) 15157**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] A
Location: VA [**Location (un) **]
Address: [**Location (un) **], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 3992**]
Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 15158**]
*Please call your primary care physician to book [**Name Initial (PRE) **] follow up
appointment within 1-3 days. It is also recommended you follow
up with a Cardiologist within 1 week of discharge. Please
discuss this with your primary care physician.
