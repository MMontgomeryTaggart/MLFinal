TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  Chest pain
   HPI:
   67 year old blind, deaf man with ESRD, htn, CAD s/p NSTEMI,
   cardiomyopathy with EF 35%, initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] hospital
   with burning chest pain radiating to shoulders. Ruled out for MI.
   Yesterday, patient returned to [**Location **] with burning chest pain radiating to
   his shoulder. No EKG changes, but known LBBB. Initial negative troponin
   negative, but afternoon trop elevated to 0.97. Overnight episodes of CP
   responded to 2 SL NTG +/- morphine. Continued to have episodes of CP
   responsive to NTG. Patient was transferred directly to [**Hospital1 5**] cath lab
   on [**7-22**].
   .
   Coronary angiography on [**7-22**] revealed a right dominant system with
   diffuse coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was without angiographically
   apparent stenosis.  The LAD had 3 sequencial stents that were widely
   patent. There was a 50% stenosis at the D1 level proximal to the
   stents.  There was diffuse disease between the 2nd and 3rd stents with
   approximately 60% stenosis, and there was a 90% focal lesion just
   distal to the 3rd stent that was new since the prior catheterization in
   [**3086-3-26**].  The D1 had 90% proximal disease that was not apparently
   changed since prior. The LCX had a widely patent stent and no
   significant disease.  The RCA had chronic subtotal occlusion in the
   mid-portion, with collaterals from the LAD distally. He had a
   successful PCI of the distal LAD with a DES which was post-dilated to
   2.5mm. At this point the patient could not tolerate further
   intervention due to marked agitation, so it was
   elected not to intervene on the D1 lesion.
   .
   After this intervention the patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 372**] 3 and
   continued to have chest pain on the floor. He continued to ask for
   nitroglycerin for chest pain overnight. EKGs were consistently
   unchanged. The pain was not relieved with a GI cocktail. Trop was 0.63,
   CK=53 on AM of [**7-23**] and previously was trop=0.97 at OSH on [**7-22**]. Due to
   his continued symptoms, he was taken to cath again on the afternoon of
   [**7-23**] after his regularly scheduled HD session. The D1 lesion was
   successfully angioplastied and a successful PCI of prox/mid LAD with
   DES was performed, but the procedure was complicated by LMCA artery
   dissection. On the last final angiography injection, the LMCA was
   dissected, at which point the patient arrested. CPR was immmediately
   initiated and atropine was given.  The Prowater wire was still in place
   in the LAD and a 3.5x28mm Xience DES was able to be delivered to the
   LMCA/prox LAD. This stent was post-dilated to 4.0 NC balloon with
   sealing of the dissection and restoration of TIMI 3 flow into the LAD
   and LCx.  The patient left the lab intubated and on 5mcg/kg/min of
   dopamine to maintain a SBP of 100-110mmHg.  Reportedly, his home SBP
   runs in the 90s-100s.
   .
   Upon transfer to the CCU the patient was sedated, intubated, and on
   dopamine to maintain his pressures.  He had a peripheral line and
   femoral sheath for access.  Initial blood gas was pH 7.53, pCO2 36, pO2
   237, HCO3 31, BaseXS 7.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o blind, deaf male w/ESRD, s/p cath on [**7-22**] with stenting of
   distal LAD stenosis.  Patient had continued chest pain and was again
   taken to cath which was complicated by LMCA dissection and cardiac
   arrest.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cath [**7-22**]: LAD w/ 3 sequential stents widely patient. 50%
   lesion at D1 proximal to stents. 60% diffuse disease between 2nd and
   3rd stents; 90% focal lesion just distal to 3rd stent (new since [**4-3**]).
   D1 with proximal 90% disease (unchanged). New stent placed over distal
   LAD lesion. Procedure stopped prematurely secondary to patient
   agitation. Patient continued to have chest pain requiring nitroglycerin
   for chest pain overnight, EKG's consistently unchanged. Unrelieved with
   maalox, GI cocktail. Trop 0.63 morning of [**7-23**]. Was 0.97 at OSH.   The
   patient underwent a second cath with successful angioplasty to the D1
   and successful PCI of prox/mid LAD with DES.  This procedure was
   complicated by LMCA dissection which caused cardiac arrest requiring
   CPR, atropine, and intubation.  The LMCA dissection was corrected by
   LMCA stenting.
   -Continue Aspirin, plavix, lipitor
   -Start low dose metoprolol when patient off of pressors
   -Hold home Imdur
   -Continue to trend enzymes post LMCA dissection and cardiac arrest to
   evaluate extent of heart damage
   -EKG, ECHO in AM
   -Will add an ACE inhibitor when BP allows
   .
   # PUMP: Has known ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 35% on [**4-3**] Echo. No
   overt clinical signs of heart failure at this time. No peripheral
   edema, crackles, or JVD.
   -Will add an ACE inhibitor when BP allows
   .
   # RHYTHM: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Sinus rhythm today.
   -C/w amiodarone, start metoprolol when pressures stabilize off of
   pressors
   .
   # Hypotension: Currently on dopamine given peripherally with goal to
   maintain pressures above 90s-100s systolic
   -C/w metoprolol, ACE inhibitor when BP stable
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient intubated and sedated following code.  Continue
   Versed/Fentanyl as needed for sedation on vent.  Patient can likely be
   extubated tomorrow morning as vent settings are on assist control with
   Tidal volume=500 cc, Respiratory rate: 18, PEEP: 5 cm/h2o, FIO2: 50%.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct dropped from 30.9 pre-procedure to 24.8 post-procedure
   which is out of proportion to what would be an expected blood loss from
   cath.  Concern for retroperitoneal bleed.
   -Hct checks q8h
   -Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor post transfusion Hct
   -Premedicate with Tylenol 1 gram and Benadryl 25mg IV as patient has
   low grade temperature of 99.7
   .
   # ESRD w/ HD on MWF: Underwent normal session of HD Friday morning
   prior to cath.
   -C/w Nephrocaps, renagel
   -F/u renal recs
   .
   # Gout
   -C/w allopurinol
   .
   # Congenital deafness: Can read lips effectively at baseline. Will
   involve ASL interpreters as needed when patient extubated.
   .
   # Peptic ulcer disease, dyspepsia: Famotidine for now.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, consider OG tube feeds if not extubated tomorrow
