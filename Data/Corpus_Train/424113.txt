Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - seen by IV access, who were unable to get access, IR placed PICC
   line.
   - femoral sheath removed, site checked @ 2153 - 1-2 cm hematoma noted
   on left femoral site, with bilateral femoral bruits auscultated,
   bilateral distal pulses 2+
   - checked HCT @ 10:47, dropped from 28.8 this AM to 25.5, patient is
   not tachycardiac, maintaining BP, Asx, will recheck at 1 AM and T&S 2
   units.
   - 1 am hct 24.2, decided against transfusion because of h/o flash
   pulmonary edema and patient hemodynamically stable and asx. Will follow
   up 5 am cbc.  Returned at 27.
   - temporarily placed on NRB due to O2 sats 85%
 93% with NRB.  On
   exam, diffuse crackles
 gave 20 mg IV lasix (pt has been
   auto-diuresing well).  Put out 110 mL in 15 mins after this.

   Patient is a 45 yo female with CAD s/p CABG, diastolic HF and kidney
   transplant presenting from [**Hospital1 **] with shortness of breath.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Known CAD s/p CABG in [**2757**].  Was cathed today which
   showed no change from previous cath in [**3-23**]- no intervention was
   performed.  Patient continues to deny chest pain.

   -ASA 81mg daily
   -atorvastatin 40mg daily
   -plavix 75mg daily
   -Ezetimibe 10 mg daily
   -Isosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) 60 mg daily
   -post-cath check showing small hematoma, bilateral buits
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   -no enzymes ordered given lack of symptoms and cath results which
   showed no changes from previous cath
   .
   # PUMP:  History of diastolic dysfunction now presented with CHF
   exacerbation.  ECHO shows "the inferolateral wall systolic dysfunction
   is more evident and the severity of mitral regurgitation has decreased
   slightly."  Went into flash pulmonary edema overnight, and received
   20mg IV lasix this AM.
   -consider 20 mg IV lasix again this AM
   -O2 wean as tolerated
   -metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -nifedipine cr 60mg daily
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient in normal sinus rhythm.
   -increase metoprolol dose if rate elevates for a sustained period of
   time
   .
   # Immune Suppression: Patient is s/p living donor kidney
   transplant.
   -continue on sirolimus 3 mg daily and tacrolimus 2 mg twice daily.
   -contact transplant regarding any dose changes needed
   -home dose of prednisone (4mg daily) continued
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type I: Last A1C on [**8-1**] was 8.7%.
   -Lantus plus sliding scale insulin.
   -monitor sugars
   .
   # Renal Disease: Patient is s/p kidney transplant. Her creatinine over
   the last year has ranged from 0.8-1.1.
   -monitor Cr given lasix administration
   -currently slightly elevated, but suspect acute pulmonary edema as
   etiology, and suspect improvement with diuresis
   .
   # Hypertension:
   -continue home doses of metoprolol and nifedipine extended release.
   .
   # Depression:
   -continue home medications of bupropion and citalopram.
   .
   # Pain: Questionable allergy to codiene- patient reports
   nausea/vomiting but has been taking oxycodone recently for ankle
   fracture.
   -continue PO oxycodone.
   .
   # Insomnia: Continue home dose of trazodone.
   .
   # Nausea: Continued reglan and zofran.
   .
   # Osteoporosis: Continued vitamin D and calcium.
   .
   FEN: replete lytes as needed.  monitor closely given patient on lasix
