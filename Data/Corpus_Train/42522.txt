Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4777**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IP rigid bronch w/ stent removal [**2419-7-14**]

History of Present Illness:
39 yo F h/o asthma, tracheobronchomalacia s/p y stent [**2511-7-9**]
and anxiety here with tachypnea. Was recently hospitalized which
required intubation on [**8-12**]/12 for worsening
tracheobronchomalacia. This was followed up by IP placing a y
stent [**7-9**]. Pt initially felt well for first 2 days. Following
this developed progressively worsening shortness of breath x 2
days, couple episodes of scant hemoptysis. Noticed inhalers
helped yesterday but no relief today. No wheezing. Has dry
coughing fits while lying supine and improves when sits up.
Talking makes SOB/cough worse. Does not endorse chest pain but
has chest discomfort from coughing. Denies nightsweats, weight
loss or fever/chills. No nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain.

ED: Initial Vitals/Trigger: 98.6 85 130/96 16 99%
IP saw in ED.  blow by humidified air mask, on 2L sat 98-99%.
Tachypneic to 30s initially but went down to 18-20.
most recent vitals 98.7, rr 16, bp 109/53, 100% RA on humidifier

Received ativan which alleviated tachypnea

On arrival to the MICU, pt was saturating well in high 90s on
RA. Boyfriend at bedside.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or

3. Possible inflammatory lung process such as hypersensitivity
pneumonitis. (Had open lung biopsy in [**10/2510**] which was reviewed

by [**Hospital1 4**] pathologists and showed undefined inflammatory process
superimposed on normal lung,and poorly formed granulomas that
seemed to be consistent with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis).
Most recent CT trachea showed no evidence of hypersensitity
pneumonitis.

CXR: FINDINGS:  The lungs appear clear.  The cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.

IP Rigid Bronch
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
standard time out was performed as per protocol. The procedure
was performed for diagnostic purposes at the operating room. A
physical exam was performed. The bronchoscope was introduced
through an endotracheal tube and advanced under direct
visualization until the tracheobronchial tree was reached.The
procedure was not difficult. The quality of the preparation was
good. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
complications.

other findings: Following general anesthesia a yellow Dumon
rigid tracheoscope was inserted with slight difficulty. The
airway was examined with flexible bronchoscopy, there was
minimal secretion in the stent, the distal airways were patent.
Using rigid forceps the Dumon Y stent was removed. The airway
was again examined, there was no granulation tissue, except a
small rim at the distal end of the LMS limb of the Y stent.

Impression: Severe Trachchiobronchomalacia
Removal of Dumon Y stent with rigid forceps through a Rigid
tracheoscope.

Recommendations: Admit to ICU
Will follow as inpatient

Additional notes: Patient medication list was reconciled.
Attending was present for the entire procedure. FINAL DIAGNOSES
are listed in the impression section above. Estimated blood loss
= zero. No specimens were taken for pathology.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 16804**] is a 39 woman who presents with shortness of breath x
2d, periodic hemoptysis with coughing since [**2511-7-14**]. Hx
signficant for severe asthma, severe tracheobronchomalacia with
air trapping treated with y stent on [**2511-7-9**]. She had her Y
stent removed on [**2511-7-15**].

#Tracheobroncheomalacia: pt has a h/o tracheomalacia s/p y stent
placement with IP on [**2511-7-9**] for worsening TCM which required
hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 16808**] where pt required intubation. Due
to recent placement of stent, this is most likely the cause of
tachypnea and hemoptysis. Does have a h/o asthma requiring
multiple intubations, but this does not seem likely to be an
asthmatic exacerbation. Per pt, on MTX for sarcoidosis and this
was held during hospitalization. Bronchoscopy was done on [**7-15**]
with interventional pulmonology. Pt was tachypneic and
distressed after bronch, and anxiety and coughing paroxysms
could only be controlled with precedex drip initially. During
this time, pt was still accepting lidocaine, albuterol and
ipratropium nebs with morphine and benzodiazepines to control
anxiety with coughing episodes. Anxiety and coughing paroxysms
would worsen to the point where pt received multiple PRN doses
of Ativan, morphine, Haldol and heliox. Of note, pt would not
desaturate during coughing episodes. Throughout hospitalization,
pt continued her home inhaled corticosteroids and oral asthma
medications. Interventional pulmonology followed patient while
in house and could not suggest other stents. Only BiPAP was
recommended which patient refused on multiple occasions. CT
surgery also assessed pt and found her to not be a good surgical
candidate for tracheoplasty. Towards the end of her MICU course,
the pt was transitioned off of the precedex drip to a low-dose
of clonidine and Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **] (although the Zyprexa was not
continued on discharge). Upon discharge, pt still had
intermittent coughing paroxysms (which was her
pre-hospitalization baseline) and still refused to use BiPAP. It
was recommended that she pursue pulmonary rehab and she was
amenable to consider this on an out-patient basis. Her
pulmonologist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 652**], was contact[**Name (NI) **] with regard to
potentially facilitating this.

#Anxiety/depression: The pt was not on benzodiazepines
pre-admission but had multiple episodes of extreme anxiety. Pt
was emotionally labile in ICU and put on precedex drip to
control anxiety associated with coughing paroxysms. The pt was
continued on home SSRI throughout hospitalization and the dose
was increased towards the end of her course. Standing Klonopin
and PRN Ativan were also added to her regimen and anxiety was
refractory to this. She also received Zyprexa during her
hospitalization, but was not discharged on this medication as
adequate clinical control was achieved with clonidine and
symptomatic (anti-tussive) medications.

Of note, the Precedex did not control her coughing, but blunted
her supratentorial / affective / emotional response to her
coughing episodes. She also responded to re-direction and
distraction during episodes as a means of terminating a paroxysm
of cough. She will likely benefit from the psychological coping
skills taught during pulmonary rehabilitation is this is able to
be established in the out-patient setting.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known patient lastname 16804**],

You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 509**]
for removal of your Y-stent. After removal of your stent with
interventional pulmonology, we strived to control your
persistent coughing and shortness of breath with numerous
interventions including light sedation. After meeting with
interventional pulmonology and cardiothoracic surgery, it was
decided that surgery is not a viable option, and would not
provide any relief of your symptoms.  Therefore supportive care
with BiPAP is best for your condition.

We made the following additions to your medications to help with
symptom control:

Codeine Sulfate 15-30 mg orally every four hours as needed for
cough
Citalopram 20 mg oral daily for associated agitation with cough
CloniDINE 0.1 mg oral three times a day for agitation with cough
- do not take this if you are feeling dizzy or lightheaded.
Lidocaine 1% 2.5 mL inhaled every 3 hours as needed for
wheezing, shortness of breath, or cough--DO NOT EXCEED THIS
DOSING AS IT CAN CAUSE FATAL CARDIAC RHYTHMS IF TAKEN IN EXCESS
Lorazepam 1-2 mg oral every 4 hours as needed for agitation
associated with cough. ***Do not take this before or while
driving.  Do not consume alcholic beverages.

We have DISCONTINUED your methotrexate as it appears to be
unneeded and can have very unfavorable side effects.

Please take all your other medications as previously prescribed.

Followup Instructions:
You should schedule the following appointments:

Interventional pulmonology- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 183**]
Pulmonology- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 652**]

Please call  ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1173**] to schedule your follow up
appointments.
