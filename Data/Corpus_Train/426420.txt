   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 85yo M with h/o non-ischemic CM with EF 30% and
   recurrent VT despite Amiodarone treatment in past admitted post-VT
   ablation to CMI service now transferred to CCU with sustained VT and
   hypotension on the floor, resolved on admission to the CCU.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Prior to transfer to CCU patient was in sustained VT not
   responsive to anti-tachycardia pacing from his ICD X 6 trials. This VT
   was not the same morphology as his previous VTs. Potentially his
   original VT was ablated unmasking other focus of VT. Now V-paced with
   IV amio bolus and 400mg PO amio.
   - Continue PO amio
   - continue Coreg as BPs allow
   - Consult EP in am re: new VT and whether he needs ICD adjustment or
   repeat procedure vs medical management
   - Continue coumadin for h/o AF->check INRs daily
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Likely medication induced as persisted after converted
   to paced rhythm and received multiple BP medications as well as extra
   dose of lasix all at the same time. Remained asymptomatic with no
   orthostasis, dizziness, chest pain. mentating, urinating throughout.
   - No further IVF necessary for now.
   - Goal BP overnight >90
   - Hold anti-hypertensives until BPs stabilize
   - Hold lasix until clinical exam in am as below
   .
   # CORONARIES: Does not have reported history of CAD however no records
   in our system of previous caths etc. Trops negative X 1 at OSH ED.
   - Continue on ACE inbitor, beta blocker
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PUMP:  History of systolic heart failure with EF on recent TTE 30%
   and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Currently hypovolemic after 40mg total
   of lasix today.
   - Received 1L NS with better BPs
   - Monitor I/O daily weights
   - If continues to be euvolemic on exam tomorrow consider decreasing
   lasix dose ->currently not written for lasix tomorrow am pending
   clinical exam
   - Continue ACE, BB as tolerated
   .
   #. Chronic Renal insufficiency: appears at baseline per OSH records.
   - Monitor creatinine daily
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: Continue synthroid
   .
   #  Gout: Continue allopurinol
   .
   FEN:  no further IVF tonight. E- replete PRN N-
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with coumadin
   -Pain management with APAP
   -Bowel regimen with coalce senna
   CODE: Presumed full ->will need confirmation in AM as well as CCU
   consent form signed.
   DISPO: CCU for now
