Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is in NSR, on no inotropes.
There is a new aortic tissue valve in place with no AI and no
leak.
Residual mean gradient = 6 mmHg.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn.
No MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2297**].

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**7-31**] where the
patient underwent an aortic valve replacement.  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Please see the operative note for details.
 POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically [**Month/Year (2) 2297**]
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  He was
thrombocytopenic post-operatively but was heparin dependent
antibody negative and his platelets slowly began to recover.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery on post-operaive day two.  Chest tubes and pacing wires
were discontinued without complication.  For DVT prophylaxis he
was given subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots, which he
should continue at rehab until he is more mobile.  The patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD
four the patient's wound wound was healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to
[**Hospital3 280**] in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
