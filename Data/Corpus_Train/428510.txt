 [**Last Name 113**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 24 yo male with type I DM, ESLD on HD, resistant HTN who
   presents with hyperglycemia and emesis and found to have significantly
   elevated blood pressures.
   .
   # Fever/Mental Status Changes/? delirium: Pt is volitionally not
   speaking right now. He does have a history of oppositional defiant
   disorder. Was agitated and confused on admission. It is difficult to do
   a neuro exam or get a sense of his mental status right now as he is not
   cooperating. Head CT read neg for any acute IC process.  Still concern
   for infection as febrile on admission, cultures negative and on broad
   spectrum Abx. Pt does have history of TTP, but platelets not low. [**Month (only) 56**]
   also have had some component of uremic encephalopathy.
   - correct glucose and electrolyte abnormalities
   - will check peripheral smear for schistocytes, but low suspicion for
   TTP in light of normal platelet count.
   - HD yesterday
   - psych following
   - will need to consider whether MRI is worth trying again as pt does
   not have capacity to refuse per psych.
   -LP shows no meningitis by cell counts. On vanc/ceftriaxone/acyclovir
   empirically pending cultures. will d/c today. would continue acyclovir
   until negative pcr
   -could consider check tsh to r/o hyperthyroid though this is lower on
   the ddx
   # Hyperglycemia: Would be classified as HHS given no ketonemia, though
   AG present. Possible etiologies include infection vs insulin
   non-compliance. AG resolved after only 10 units of IM regular insulin
   with serum glucose ranging <70 to 200
s over past day.
   - check FSBS q2 hours
   - [**Last Name (un) 257**] following- on lantus 4 units daily and [**Last Name (un) 257**] sliding scale
   and conservative sliding scale
   - blood, csf, and urine cxs to rule out infection
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: low BS this am. got [**11-22**] amp D50. ? whether insulin
   should be decreased. [**Last Name (un) 257**] following.
   .
   # Anion Gap Acidosis: Resolved. Possible etiologies include toxic
   ingestion vs lactic acidosis or [**12-23**] chronic renal failure. Unlikely to
   be ketoacidosis given negative serum ketoacids. However, AG resolved
   after only 10 units of IM insulin. Tox screen positive only for
   opiates. Lactate 1. Most likely [**12-23**] RF.
    - cont to monitor lytes
   .
   # Hypertension: BP 200's/100's on admission. Has run similarly high on
   previous admissions. Attempting to titrating meds to SBP's in 150's.
   However, still elevated
   -off labetalol drip. On metoprolol TID and amlodipine, unclear to me
   whether he is consistently taking his PO meds
   -added  IV enalapril yesterday, perhaps could switch to PO lisinopril
   10 today, which is his home med if he is able to tolerate POs
   .
   # ESRD on HD: HD on [**7-27**], took off 800cc.
   - renal dialysis fellow aware pt in house
   - cont nephrocaps
   -add sevelamer per renal
   .
   #Anemia: s/p 1 unit PRBC. Likely [**12-23**] chronic renal failure (baseline
   about 25)
   -hct at baseline
   -epo after HD
   .
   #hematuria: most c/w foley trauma.
   -follow up and send UA
