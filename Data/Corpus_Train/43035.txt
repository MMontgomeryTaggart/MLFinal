None.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 38 yo male with DM1 complicated by severe
gastroparesis, poorly controlled hypertension with severe
autonomic dysfunction, ESRD on HD (Tu/Th/Sat), CAD, who is well
known to medicine service for multiple admissions secondary to
hypertensive emergency and gastroparesis, discharged yesterday,
who presented to the ED with elevated BP, nausea/vomiting and
back pain. Mild back pain in thorac
.
On review of systems, the patient denies any chest pain,
shortness of breath, fevers, chills, weight loss, night sweats,
fatigue, headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, sore throat,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, any new rashes, denies
dysuria, hematuria, increased urgency, diarrhea, constipation,
hematochezia, melena, epistaxis. All other systems were reviewed
in detail and were negative except for what has been mentioned
above.
.
He was last admitted on [**7-4**] for question of seizure and
elevated cardiac enzymes. Cardiology was consulted and felt that
this leak most likely represented subendocardial ischemia in the
setting of severe hypertension and tachycardia. He was
discharged on a baby aspirin, beta blocker, ace inhibitor, and
was continued on his regular coumadin dose. Seizure/altered
mental status was attributed to hypertension.
.
In the ED, was hypertensive to the 250s, was started on
labetolol and nitro drip. SBP in 130s. Received dose of toprol
prior ot tranfer. ECG with prominent repolarization in the
anterior leads. Cardiology did not think it was concerning.
Troponins were more elevated than prior, attributed to renal
insufficiency.

CTA CHEST [**3417-5-24**]

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of aortic dissection, as clinically questioned.
2.  Left ventricular hypertrophy, consistent with reported
history of
hypertension.
3.  Diffuse, dense vascular calcifications, including coronary
artery
calcifications, much greater than expected for patient's age.
4.  Extensive collateral venous drainage with associated focal
narrowing of the left subclavian vein.

CT ABDOMEN-PELVIS [**3417-5-24**]

Note is made of bilateral mild gynecomastia.  There is a right
chest port and
a right central venous catheter in place.

The liver is normal, without focal lesions.  No intra- or
extra-hepatic
biliary ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
glands and
spleen are normal.  Note is made of a prominent ampulla
projecting into the
duodenum (sequence 3A, image 127) that likely is a normal
finding.

The bowel is unremarkable.  The kidneys demonstrate symmetric
enhancement
without hydronephrosis or focal lesions.

No abdominal free fluid or lymphadenopathy.

The urinary bladder, rectum, prostate and sigmoid colon are
unremarkable.  No
pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.

No suspicious osseous lesions.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypertensive urgency:
Pt has a history of widely fluctuating BP [**1-3**] autonomic
instability. There is also medication non-adherence. There is no
sign of end-organ damage now with the HTN. He occasionally has
EKG changes (TWI) as a result of demand ischemia. He was on a
nitro drip in the ED and again on the floor. His outpatient
medications were re-started and imdur was added to the regimen.
It was after the addition of Imdur that the patient??????s BP
stabilized at 100s systolic. He at one point became hypotensive
and required bolus of 500ccs, with BP meds held. At discharge,
he was tolerating well his regimen of meds and was normotensive.

.  He complained of back pain which is a new complaint in him,
and CTA chest was reassuring that there was no aortic
dissection. For other findings see report above.
.
# N/V and abdominal pain:
Pt with multiple admissions with similar complaints, etiology
[**1-3**] gastroparesis, pain is now resolved. He responds to dilaudis
and ativan. He was transitioned from NPO to clears to full to
regular, and he was able to tolerate regular at dc.
Abdomen-pelvis CT was obtained to rule out other pathologies
that might have been masked by gastroparesis. There were none.
.
=Anticoagulation: 2 days prior to discharge, the patient??????s INR
became elevated (6 and above) and his coumadin was dced. Even
after the coumadin was dc, his INR increased the next day and
subsequently trended down rapidly.

.# DMI:
- c/w home NPH 3 units [**Hospital1 **], RISS
.
# ESRD:
etiology [**1-3**] DM and HTN,
- continued on usual schedule, usual T/Th/Sat, renal following
and HD also as needed, such as after contrast for CT scans.
- Contact[**Name (NI) **] Transplant team to discuss options for pancreas and
kidney transplant. Pt had been relying on former girlfriend to
[**Name2 (NI) 18534**] kidney, but that is no longer an option. Transplant team
aware of this.
