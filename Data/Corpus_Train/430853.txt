TITLE:
   Pt examined, discussed with CCU team. Please see housestaff admission
   note for details.
   Briefly, this is a 67y/o M with DM, mechanical AVR ([**2698**]), CAD s/p CABG
   (SVGs known occluded, LIMA-LAD patent, native LAD and LCx 40% stenoses,
   RCA no lesions), EF 20%, ascending aorta repair with graft ([**2698**]), h/o
   VF arrest s/p AICD [**2705**], recurrent high grade coag neg staph and VRE
   s/p removal of leads in past, now transferred to [**Hospital1 52**] with shortness
   of breath. D/c on [**8-20**] after aggressive diuresis and cath [**8-17**]
   demonstrating elevated left and right sided filling pressures (PCWP 26
   mm Hg, RVEDP 20 mm Hg). A few hours after d/c, pt states he was
   straining to have bm when developed acute onset of shortness of breath.
   He was given lasix 80 IV at rehab (?u/o but reportedly pt improved). Pt
   was taken to [**Hospital 112**] Hospital where CXR showed pulmonary edema and a
   U/A was reportedly + for wbc and nitrites. He was hypotensive to SBP
   80s-90s. Cultures were taken and pending. He was started on levophed.
   Given extensive records and recent admission here, he was transferred
   this am. Per wife left hospital at 241.2 lbs. Here CXR suggestive of
   pulmonary edema.
   PE T 97.7, BP 97/62, P 70, RR 16, 100% 12L ventimask
   Somnolent, but arousable to voice and touch
   JVP ~12 cm
   RRR, II/VI short early systolic murmur, sharp mechanical S2
   Lungs with mild rales at bases, otherwise good air movement
   Abd distended, NT
   RLE 1+ pitting edema (also of bilateral upper extremities)
   Labs notable for wbc 13.4, Cr 1.3, U/A >1000 wbc, neg nit. CK 41, Tn
   0.09.
   ECG SR at 61 bpm, LBBB, LAD
   Imp: Recurrent pulmonary edema/ CHF, possibly precipitated by HTN/
   valsalva during straining for bm. Unclear if received additional volume
   load. Hypotension may be related to UTI/?SIRS/septic physiology.
   Plan:
   1.       Diuresis with iv lasix to goal negative 1 L today
   2.       Daily weight
   3.       Wean levophed as able
   4.       Follow biomarkers, but thus far no evidence of ACS; no need
   for cath
   5.       Goal SBP max 120
   6.       Follow urine and blood cultures re infection; given
   hypotension, would agree with housestaff to rx with abx
   7.       Remainder of plan as per housestaff
