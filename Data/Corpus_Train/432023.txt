Chief Complaint:  ETOH withdrawal
   HPI:
   This is a 57 year old man with PMH of depression and history of ETOH
   abuse who presented to the ED after a binge period of drinking [**3-11**]
   liters vodka for the last 3 days, with auditory/tactile halluncinations
   and tremulousness since he ran out of alcohol at 7am today. He denies
   any loss of consciousness or seizures. He also denies vomiting, though
   he was nauseous in the ED and received zofran with good effect. He
   denies visual hallucinations. He denies SI/HI. No fevers/chills.  He
   denies history of seizures with withdrawal. No fall or loss of
   consciousness.
   .
   Of note, the patient has had multiple past admissions for alcohol
   withdrawal, the most recent ones [**3259-9-30**] and [**3259-10-3**]. She required 50mg
   valium on last admission and 130mg valium on the admission before that.

   [**Hospital1 9469**] and [**Hospital1 **] previously.
   .
   Also, patient has been evaluated in the past for SVT by EP and placed
   on verapamil. However, on his last two admissions, he had not been on
   verapamil as an inpatient as he had never had the prescription filled
   in the outpatient setting.
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 year old man with a past history of alcohol abuse, who
   presents with ETOH level of 229 along with symptoms of withdrawal, with
   high requirements by CIWA scale for treatment.
   .
   ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL
   High requirements in the ED. Continuing CIWA scale. Needing close
   monitoring at this point given frequency of return of symptoms;
   however, hopefully should be able to complete latter part of withdrawal
   management on the floor.
   - continue CIWA q1 hr, valium 10-20mg for CIWA >10
   - zofran for nausea (will also check amylase/lipase given his nausea)
   - continue low-dose home amlodipine and atenolol
   - restart venlafaxine given interaction of EtOH w depression in this
   pt; likely having some venlafaxine w/d symptoms unrelated to EtOH w/d
   as well
   - continue thiamine, folate, MVI
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS
   AST mildly higher than ALT. Consistent with prior labs. Alcoholic
   hepatitis likely although NASH, viral hepatitis given substance abuse
   history are also possible. Hepatitis serologies negative on [**3259-10-2**].
   CT abdomen/pelvis [**7-15**] showed fatty liver, normal liver contour.
   - trend labs
   - continue effexor at home dose given that he has been stable on this,
   may need dose reduction if liver impairment increases
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   Creatinine elevated to 1.3 (baseline 1.1-1.2). Likely somewhat prerenal
   in the setting of recent binge.
   - Check urine lytes if continues to trend up
   - If unable to take [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] give maintenance fluids
   .
   HYPERTENSION
   Patient hypertensive on admission, likely secondary to ETOH withdrawal.
   Also with baseline hypertension.
   -continue home atenolol and amlodipine
   DEPRESSION
   No current SI/HI
   -Continue outpatient venlafaxine.
   .
   FEN: Maintenance fluids, replete as needed, regular diet as tolerated
   .
   PPx: SubQ heparin, no PPI indicated
   .

   unwilling to give good assessment of code status)
