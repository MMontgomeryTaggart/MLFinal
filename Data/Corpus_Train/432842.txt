   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of
   hypertension, diastolic CHF who presents with new onset tachyarrhythmia
   with long conversion pauses.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Unclear if this is a.fib/flutter with abberancy vs.
   another SVT. Long conversion pauses concerning tachy-brady syndrome.
   Currently hemodynamically stable. No signs of ischemic cause, likely
   age related conduction degradation in setting of dCHF. However, stable
   now in bigeminy.
   - if becomes fast again and unstable, will float temporary pacer wire
   to manage pauses/bradycardia
   - pacer pads in place
   - rate control with 25mg PO metoprolol TID
   - will likely need permanent pacemaker
   - heparin gtt for prophylaxis, will bridge to coumadin after pacemaker
   .
   # PUMP: History of very well controlled dCHF on no diuretics. No signs
   of decompensation at this time.
   - BB as above
   - Will hold lisinopril given concern for relative hypotension if heart
   rhythm destabilizes. If hypertensive, can restart.
   .
   # Coronaries: No signs of ischemia currently. CEZ neg. No ischemic
   changes on EKG.
   -Con't ASA 81, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # HTN:
   - Hold amlodipine and lisinopril until HR stable
   - Increase metoprolol as above
   .
   # Depression: Continue lexapro
   .
   # Osteoarthritis: PRN tylenol, continue calcium carbonate, MVI
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue simvastatin
   .
   # Insomnia: Con't PRN alprazolam
   .
   FEN: Heart healthy diet
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, R IJ cordis
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with Heparin gtt
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen
