   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment:  42 year old male with hx of alcohol and Hep C related
   cirrhosis p/w
   1.  Sepsis - Resolving, is afebrile w/ resolving WBC count trended
   down, dramatically improved mental status, some continued tachycardia
   w/ HR ~120s.  Most likely source SBP: > 500 WBCs in ascitic fluid;
   preliminary cxs show no growth.
   -Given that SBP most likely source, would narrow coverage to vanc and
   ceftriaxone (had enterococcal SBP in past so imp to continue vanc) to
   complete 5 day course + can D/c flagyl.
   -Would continue albumin at dose of 1 gm/kg (albumin on day 3 improves
   survival benefit) and would d/c after today's dose.
   -F/u blood, urine, peritoneal cxs although preliminary reports suggest
   no growth.
   .
   2. Mental status change -  Improving.  Delirium secondary to underlying
   SBP most likely; hepatic encephalopathy less likely as pt has been
   compliant w/ lactulose regimen and has had no recent worsening of
   hepatic function.
   -Continue home lactulose 60 mg q3 hrs
   -Tx of underlying infection
   .
   3. Alcoholic and Hep C related cirrhosis
   -Why not on nadolol, spirinolactone or lasix? review chart and find out
   if contraindication to these medicines, as he has refractory ascites;
   should be on diuretics.
   -Daily coags, platelets, LFTs
   -Consult liver
   .
   4.  Acute renal failure - Given urinary lytes, BUN/Cr ratio and
   response to fluids, most likely etiology is prerenal.  Could be
   secondary to dehydration or hepatorenal.  ATN less likely.  Urine
   output is 30 cc/hr (has declined
   -Fluid challenge this AM w/ 1 L NS, follow urine output and repeat Cr
   this PM.
   -Continue albumin today
   -Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -Renally dose meds
   .
   5.  Hypothyroidism
   -Continue on home levothyroxine
   .
   6.  Anxiety disorder
   -Continue on home
   .
   7. Osteoporosis
   -Calcium and vitamin D
   .
   8. Anemia
   -Stable, not actively bleeding
   -Follow daily HCTs
   .
   9.  FEN - IV NS 1 L as seems intravascularly dry, check electrolytes
   daily, continue TF
   .
   10. Prophylaxis - SC heparin, lactulose, PPI
