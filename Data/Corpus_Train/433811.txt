   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 year old male with HTN and tobacco abuse who presents with
   5 days of intermittent chest discomfort, worsening shortness of breath
   found to have evidence of older lateral ischemic changes and new 4+MR
   .
   # CORONARIES: Likely had an event on [**11-8**] with possible stuttering
   plaque since then. Old due to Q-waves on EKG. Risk factors of HTN, and
   tobacco abuse. Unknown lipids - pending.
   - Given age of infarct, unlikely to benefit from heparin at this time
   - Holding BB, ACEi given relative hypotension and HR in the 60s
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80
   - Holding further plavix until surgery  (already received plavix at
   [**Hospital1 **] ED)
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - F/u lipid panel
   - Counsel smoking cessation
   .
   # PUMP: Signs of acute pulmonary edema on history, exam, and CXR.
   Likely due to acute MR. MR likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction
   from MI. (Also with severe TR)
   - Unable to afterload reduce with meds given borderline BPs
   - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt
 decrease rate from 5 to 3, and hold
   as needed for hypotension; goal if possible -250cc/24 hours, but
   prioritize BP over diuresis as clinically comfortable even with fluid
   on-board
   - If becomes any more unstable, to cath lab emergently for IABP
   - Formal TTE planned on Monday for now
   - CT surgery c/s for question re: timing of surgery given prior plavix
   load, likely will need 5-day washout if possible
   .
   # PNEUMONIA: Febrile overnight, findings on CXR
   - Continue levofloxacin 750 mg PO Q24H, day 1 was [**11-13**], plan for 5 day
   course
   - sputum culture
   - f/u blood cultures both at [**Hospital1 **] & [**Hospital1 5**]
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR
   -Monitor on telemetry
   .
   FEN: NPO for now
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SC
   -Bowel regimen
   .

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9292**], [**Doctor Last Name 5991**], [**Doctor Last Name 3571**], [**Doctor Last Name **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   47 year old woman with htn, pericardial tamponade secondary to
   malignant pericardial effusion from adenocarcinoma of the breast.
   Presented with chest discomfort, dyspnea and
   clinical/echocardiographic/ECG findings consistent with large
   pericardial effusion. History notable for two prior malignancies ([**2711**]
   s/p lumpectomy/XRT/chemo and [**11/2717**] s/p modified radical mastectomy +
   adriamycin/cytoxan/tamoxifen. found to have recurrence in chest wall
   s/p femara (which patient self-discontinued).
   Now s/p pericardiocentesis of 1L on 10.10 with continued drainage
   necessitating pericardial window/talc pleurodesis. Pleural fluid
   cytology c/w adenocarcinoma and imaging of spine demonstrates
   metastases to lumbar spine. Chest tube pulled last night. Pain control
   improving. Patient aware of advanced stage of malignancy.
   Physical Examination
   AF, HR 93-113 bpm, BP 112/53 mm hg, 97% RA
   Exam per [**Hospital 152**]
   Medical Decision Making
   1. Metastatic recurrent adenocarcinoma of breast: s/p pericardial
   window/talc pleurodesis, chest tube pulled yesterday. Heme-oncology to
   determine next step in regards to possible chemotherapeutic options.
   -No evidence of recurrent effusion, patient ambulating with physical
   therapy
   -Transfer to floor
   -Continue optimizing pain control regimen.
   2. Social: Patient with limited resources and difficulty making
   outpatient appointments. Would benefit from skilled rehabilitation
   facility with ability to access medical care system. Heme-onc social
   worker and nurse working with patient
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 9240**], [**Location (un) **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 35 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Critical care required because recent tamponade, s/p recent chest tube
   removal, pain control requiring high doses of narcotics and skilled
   nursing care.
