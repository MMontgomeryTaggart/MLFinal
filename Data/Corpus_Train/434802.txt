   Imaging: Cardiac Cath:
   1. Two vessel obstructive coronary artery disease with chronically

   2. Systolic dysfunction with severe inferior and posterobasal
   hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 30-35%.

   CXR [**11-15**]
   FINDINGS: The opacity at the left lung base has increased, there is a
   new
   left pleural effusion. The findings may represent atelectasis, however,
   infection is not excluded. The right basilar opacity remains present.
   There is no overrt pulmonary edema. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Right
   pleural effusion has decreased.
   Assessment and Plan
 This is a 50 year old male with HTN and tobacco abuse who presents
   with 5 days of intermittent chest discomfort, worsening shortness of
   breath found to have evidence of older lateral ischemic changes and new
   4+MR
   .
   # CORONARIES: Likely had an event on [**11-8**] with possible stuttering
   plaque since then. Old due to Q-waves on EKG. Risk factors of HTN, and
   tobacco abuse. LDL WNL, HDL low.  Underwent R and L heart cath [**11-15**]
   with results as above, TTE consistent.
   - Anticipate CT surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1012**] Fri for MV repair and 2 vessel
   CABG.
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 86**] re: any additional necessary pre-surgery w/u
   - Given age of infarct, no heparin for now
   - Holding BB given relative hypotension and HR in the 60s
   - ASA 325, atorvastatin 80, Captopril (also for afterload reduction)
   - Holding further plavix until surgery
   - counsel smoking cessation
   .
   # Possible PNA:  Possible PNA, ?consolidation seen at OSH CXR, low
   grade fever on initial presentation, on Levaquin initiated [**11-13**] on
   five day course.
   - Continue Levaquin until [**11-17**]
   .
   # PUMP: Signs of acute pulmonary edema on history, exam, and CXR.
   Likely due to acute MR. MR likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction
   from MI.   Right and left heart cath showed mildly elevated R and L
   heart pressures, but will prioritize ACEi over Lasix given hypotension
   overnight.
   - f/u TTE final read
   - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt; goal -500cc today
   - Afterload reduction with Captopril; prioritize ACEi over Lasix if pt
   becomes hypotensive again
   - If becomes any more unstable, to cath lab for IABP
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR
   -Monitor on telemetry

   # Elevated LFTs:  Downtrending, likely [**3-1**] recent MI.

   TITLE:
   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s) [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   50 year old man with tobacco abuse and hypertension, with hours of
   chest discomfort and dyspnea several days ago while in [**Country 3423**].
   Returned to U.S. and then developed progressive dyspnea, orthopnea,
   PND, cough, subjective fever/chills. Presented to MWMC on [**2726-11-13**]
   where he was found to be hypoxemic, ECG consistent with completed
   inferoposterolateral MI. TTE there reportedly showed lateral
   hypokinesis and severe mitral regurgitation, RV reportedly with normal
   function. CK 404; transferred to [**Hospital1 5**]. Since arrival, improved
   oxygenation with gentle diuresis, supplemental oxygen. No new ECG
   changes. Denies chest pain, dyspnea, PND.
   -Overnight, rested comfortably. Denied dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea,
   chest discomfort.
   -Underwent TTE yesterday, which I personally reviewed. Demonstrates
   akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls with tethering of the
   posterior mitral valve leaflet resulting in an eccentric, posteriorly
   directed jet of moderate to severe MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] approximately 40%. RV
   normal in size/function. No pericardial effusion. Other valves
   structurally normal. No pulmonary hypertension.
   -Cardiac catheterization 10.19 demonstrated proximally occluded RCA
   with L-R collaterals and proximal (subacute) occlusion of LCx due to
   thrombotic lesion. Given captopril in cath lab without hypotension,
   IABP not inserted. Markedly elevated left sided filling pressures
   (LVEDP30 mm Hg, PCWP 20, CI 2.0, RA 10, RVEDP 15)
   -Tolerating captopril and low-dose furosemide gtt although blood
   pressure still
   -CT surgery planning on surgery later this week after repeat TTE done
   to assess severity of MR.
   Physical Examination
   37.6 p 50-58 bpm, BP 81-91/47-64 mm Hg, 98% 3L NC
   I/O 1.1/1.8 L
   Medical Decision Making
   1. Inferoposterolateral MI complicated by posterior mitral leaflet
   tethering with moderate to severe MR:
   Tolerating low-dose captopril and diuresis with low dose furosemide
   gtt.
   Cardiac catheterization with 2 vessel CAD and markedly elevated left
   sided filling pressures. RCA lesion likely chronic, LCx subacute
   (thrombotic occlusion).
   Continue aspirin, statin, holding clopidogrel (last dose Saturday). No
   beta-blocker for now given hypotension.
   2. Mitral regurgitation: TTE with moderate to severe mitral
   regurgitation from MI with resulting posterior mitral leaflet
   tethering; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1012**] to evaluate for mitral valve repair + 2 vessel
   CABG which may take place Thursday/Friday.
   Treating for possible pneumonia with levofloxacin  (?LLL consolidation
   seen at outside hospital, although has remained afebrile here and
   without clinical findings to suggest PNA) with levofloxacin
