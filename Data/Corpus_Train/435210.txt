Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   70yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p CABG x 2 who was admitted to an OSH this
   summer after a MVC where she was found to have poly-trauma,
   including SAH/SDH w/small midline shift, R L2 transverse process fx,
   T12 burst fx, R acetabular non-displaced fx, R inf and L sup pubic
   ramus fx, R 6th rib fx, L medial femoral condyle, proximal fibula. She
   was stabilized, trached per trauma protocol, and eventually d/c'ed to
   rehab in [**8-8**]. She decompensated in rehab and was admitted to an OSH
   ICU on [**9-7**] to an OSH ICU with anginal CP and SOB. She ruled out for MI,
   but was found to have bilateral infiltrates on chest CT concerning for
   pulmonary edema vs a diffuse infectious process. Sputum was positive
   for MRSA. TTE (at OSH) revealed EF 35%, 2+ MR, 1+ TR. She was diuresed
   with good effect, though prior to discharge was found to have a
   pneumonia and she
was started on Vanc and Zosyn because she grew MRSA
   from her sputum
 per CCU admit note. She was transferred to the CCU at
   [**Hospital1 17**]; chest CT revealed diffuse ground glass pulmonary infiltrates. PA
   catheterization revealed PCWP of 18-22, for which she was diuresed with
   some improvement in superimposed pulmonary edema but without resolution
   of the ground glass opacities. She had two mini-BALs that grew MRSA and
   ESBL-klebsiella, and she was treated with vancomycin and meropenem
   through to [**3120-10-6**]. She was empirically started on TMP-SMX and steroids
   for possible PCP ([**3120-10-6**]), though the mini-BALs came back negative for
   PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was stopped on [**10-6**] on transfer to the MICU. On [**9-24**] she
   started Vanc 1g IV q12, Cefepime 2g IV q12, Cipro 400 IV q12 (d/c'ed
   [**3120-10-6**].) On [**9-25**], Neurosurgery placed extraventricular drainage system
   for ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus ([**2-2**] debris from her prior SAH.)
   On [**9-26**] mini-BAL grew klebs; cefepime changed to [**Last Name (un) 600**]. On [**9-28**] CTA
   without PE. On [**10-4**] hypotensive to 70s in the afternoon, briefly on
   levophed and bolused. On [**10-5**] repeat CT showed pneumomediastinum.
   Bronched [**10-7**]. Family meeting [**10-7**]
 DNR. From [**10-7**]
 [**10-11**] she was off
   and on Neo for intermittently dropping SBP possibly related to a
   central / CNS process.
   24 Hour Events:
 Blood in CSF drain with subsequent CT showing a small bleed in the
   left frontal lobe.
 Continued to wean her continous Versed and Fentanyl.

   Assessment and Plan
   70yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p CABG x 2 who was admitted to an OSH this
   summer after a MVC with poly-trauma, including SAH/SDH w/small midline
   shift and multiple orthopedic injuries, now with ARDS of unclear
   etiology (possibly MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia.)
 INFECTIOUS DISEASE
   Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped on [**10-6**] on transfer from
   the CCU. CMV viral load was 3700 which is of unclear significance
   will repeat; BAL revealed persistent Staph and Klebsiella in her lower
   respiratory tract cultures and will continue Vanc and Meropenem for
   this (last day is [**10-15**].) Galactomannan and beta-glucan are negative.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Continue to wean her Fentanyl and Versed with Zyprexa for break-through
   agitation / anxiety. Her underlying mental status is entirely unclear
   given she has not been evaluated off of sedation.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   She did not do well with a CVP >8; maintain a low CVP and diurese as
   needed / as she is able.
 ANEMIA
   Follow H/H. Transfuse for Hgb < 7. No e/o acute bleeding.
 HYPOTENSION
   She had transient hypotension last night in the setting of her
   respiratory decompensation. She requried pressors for several hours
   overnight, but is currently off pressors. Her physiology is likely
   volume depletion exacerbated by bolus sedation as she responded to
   volume repletion and she has weaned off pressors with minimal other
   intervention.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   She had an acute decompensation last night in the setting of being
   turned, it was transient and her pulmonary physiology is actually
   improved over the past week. Her compliance (as measured by the
   ventilator) has improved from 7 to 14 (several days ago) to 40 today.
   It
s unclear why her pulmonary compliance is improving; regardless, we
   will continue to attempt to decrease her driving pressure with a short
   term goal of decreasing her peak pressure to <30cm H2O and a longer
   term goal of decreasing her with a goal of liberating her from the
   vent.
