   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o female with h/o PCKD s/p bilateral nephrectomy with liver cysts
   resulting in ESLD on transplant list and ruptured [**Doctor Last Name **] aneurysm s/p
   clipping with residual R sided hemiparesis admitted [**11-23**] from HD to
   MICU [**Location (un) **] with hypotension and MRSA bacteremia/peritonitis.  Tx with
   vanc/CTX.  Called out [**11-25**].  On floor [**11-27**] developed recurrent, fluid
   refractory hypotension and was transferred to MICU green.  Of note,
   earlier today, the patient got a TTE with new apical hypokinesis with
   aneurysm formation and a worsening intraventricular gradient.
    # Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis - possibly from partially
   treated MRSA bacteremia or another microorganism.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime, consider gent if clinically worsens
   - IVF to maintain MAPs and bring down HR
   - Pan culture: blood/paritoneal fluid
   - Recheck lactate
   - U/S fistula to r/o fluid collection (stopped working day PTA)
   # TTE: Echo with new apical hypokinesis with aneurysm formation and a
   worsening intraventricular gradient.  Concerning for recent MI that
   went unrecognized.
   - IVF for hypotension
   - BB when BP allows
   - Continue asa and lipitor
   # ESLD: Now with evidence of MRSA SBP
   - Continue midodrine, albumin
   - On Transplant list
   # Hypoxia: Likely from volume overload due to missing HD today.
   - Stable on 1L. [**Month (only) 8**] need to increase with volume resuscitation.
   # ESRD: Due for HD today, but held [**2-19**] hypotension.
