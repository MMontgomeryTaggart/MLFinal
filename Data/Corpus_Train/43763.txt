Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18203**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3150-8-1**] Replacement of Ascending Aorta utilizing a 26 millimeter
Gelweave Graft under Circulatory Arrest.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old female who presented to cardiologist with
new onset chest discomfort. She underwent ETT/MIBI which was
positive for ischemia. Subsequent cardiac catheterization
revealed minimal coronary artery disease but notable for a
dilated aortic root. Chest CT scan was then performed which
showed an ascending aortic aneursym measuring 5.3 x 5.1
centimeters. Based upon the above results, she was referred for
cardiac surgical intervention. Prior to the operation,
echocardiogram revealed [**2-7**]+ aortic insufficiency with only
trivial mitral regurgitation. LVEF was estimated at 55% and
ascending aorta measured 5.1 centimeters.

Past Medical History:
Ascending Aortic Aneursym
Mild Aortic Insufficiency
Hypertension
Elevated Cholesterol
Prior Cholecystectomy
History of Colitis


Social History:
Live with her husband. [**Name (NI) **] son is her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 21188**] for the
absence of current tobacco use. Former smoker who stopped over
25yrs ago. There is no history of alcohol abuse. No drug use.


Family History:
There is questionable family history of premature coronary
artery disease in her brother. [**Name (NI) **] father had an MI in his later
life. No h/o sudden cardiac death.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: BP 125/80, HR 88, RR 16
General: elderly female in no acute distress, very pleasant
HEENT: oropharynx benign,

CHEST (PA & LAT)

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman with sob
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess interval change
STUDY: PA and lateral chest.

HISTORY: 70-year-old woman with shortness of breath and status
post thoracic surgery.

FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette is again prominent compared to
the immediate postoperative scan, however is unchanged compared
to the scan from yesterday. Median sternotomy wires are seen.
There is again seen bilateral small pleural effusions, right
side equal to left. No focal consolidation or overt pulmonary
edema is seen. Degenerative changes are seen of the thoracic
spine.

1. Cardiomegaly, which is stable since the [**3150-8-5**] study.

INTERPRETATION:

interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Overall normal
LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Markedly dilated ascending
aorta. Focal
calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter.
Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving
vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). A prominent
septal
hypertrophy localized inferior to the LVOTis seen. No [**Male First Name (un) **]
physiology noted.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta
is markedly dilated There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate
([**2-7**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive
infusions including phenylephrine and was A-paced.

1. Biventricular function is preserved.
2. An ascending aorta graft is seen.
3. AI is slightly reduced.
4. Other findings are unchanged.













Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 21189**] was admitted and underwent replacement of her
ascending aorta by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19576**]. For surgical details, please
see seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation,
she was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. She maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from
inotropic support without difficulty. Her CSRU course was
otherwise uneventful and she transferred to the SDU on
postopertive day one. Low dose beta blockade was resumed and
advanced as tolerated. She experienced some shortness of breath
on POD#5 and was diuresed.  She was discharged to home in stable
condition on POD#6.
