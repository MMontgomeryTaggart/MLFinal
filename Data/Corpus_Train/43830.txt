Pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient firstname **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known patient lastname 1804**] is a 38yo F ALL s/p double cord blood
SCT [**1-/2537**] c/b GVHD, severe left ventricular systolic
dysfunction attributed to chemotherapy for ALL as well as XRT
for [**Year (4 digits) 1581**] (EF 15-20%), embolic CVA now on coumadin, asthma,
hypertension and chronic kidney disease, well-known to the [**Year (4 digits) 1581**]
service who was just discharged yesterday ([**2538-8-20**]) after a
prolonged hospital course for acute on chronic CHF thought be be
due to cardiac GVHD and acute on chronic renal failure. She was
discharged home with daily infusions of IV torsamide and
methylprednisolone. She came to clinic today fopr follow-up
where she was found to be febrile to 102 and up 0.5lbs from her
discharge weight. CXR was done and cardiac silloette was
increased, concerning for pleural effusion. Blood (PICC and
peripheral) and urine cultures were sent, and she was started on
empiric meropenem.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt has no complaints. She spent an hour
outside yesterday and was otherwise at home resting. She does
nto recal any bug bites. She did not feel subjectively febrile.
She has some cough, but no different or worse than prior to
discharge. She has some pedal [**Last Name (un) **],a put attributes this to
being up and walking around today. No calf pain. Otherwise, ROS
is negative. Per her sister, the pt got her torsemide and
methyprednisolone in clinic today. [**Name6 (MD) **] outpatient NP, pt's
weight was 137# today, up slightly from 136.5# on the day of
discharge.

IMAGING:
CXR ([**2538-8-21**]):
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA
and lateral
chest examination of [**2538-8-13**]. The heart size has increased
further in
size. There is no typical configurational abnormality. The
rather general
increase of the heart shadow is suggestive of pericardial
effusion. Previously described right-sided PICC line remains in
unchanged position.
Pulmonary vascular congestive pattern has not changed
significantly; however, the previously described patchy and
partially confluenting parenchymal densities persist and
apparently have progressed further. They are most marked in the
mid lung field on the right side and the lateral upper lobe area
on the left. Lateral pleural sinuses are partially concealed by
the described parenchymal densities. Conclusive evidence of
pleural effusion is not present, and major pleural effusion is
unlikely as it did not exist on the lateral view on the
preceding chest examination.
.
Progression of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in this patient
on stem cell
transplant therapy.
.
Echo ([**2538-8-22**]):  Moderate ?partially loculated pericardial
effusion without definite evidence for tamponade physiology.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2538-8-14**],
the pericardial effusion is larger. Serial evaluation is
suggested.
.
Echo ([**2538-8-28**]):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
Echo ([**2538-9-2**]):
The left atrium appears extrinsically compressed (mildly)
posteriorly, possibly by a consolidated posterior pericardial
effusion. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. with depressed
free wall contractility. The epicardial surface of the right
ventricle as well as atria appears to be encased in a layer of
echodense material (epicardial fat vs consolidated effusive
material). No evidence of cardiac tamponade seen.
.
RUQ ([**2538-9-2**]):
1. No evidence of acute cholecystitis, as clinically queried.
2. Reversed flow in the main portal vein, could be secondary to
cardiac
tamponade or tricuspid regurgitation.
3. Redemonstration of FNH in the right hepatic lobe.
4. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions and a small amount
of ascites


Brief Hospital Course:
38 year old female with ALL s/p cord blood transplant
complicated by multi-organ GVHD admitted directly to the ICU for
recurrent fever and increased pulmonary infiltrates on CXR.

#Sepsis:
Patient presented to the clinic with fevers to 102; CXR showed
increased pulmonary infiltrates and heart size. She received a
dose of meropenem, blood and urine cultures were sent, and she
was admitted directly to the ICU. After transfer to the ICU she
was given IV fluids and continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics
(vancomycin, cefepime), antifungal (voriconazole) and antiviral
(gancyclovir). Bronchoscopy lavage fluid was sent for
pan-culture, pneumocystis smear, and CMV screen. CMV pneumonitis
was suspected given previous BAL CMV+. Hypoxia and work of
breathing worsening and she required intubation for ventilation
(see below). Microbiology revealed parainfluenza 3, but no other
pathogens: sputum bacterial and fungal cultures + BAL
cultures/stains/labs were all negative, including negative PCRs
for PCP and CMV. She received vancomycin, cefepime, ganciclovir,
voriconazole, and amphotericin B for broad anti-bacterial,
anti-fungal, and anti-viral coverage. She also received four
doses of IVIG.
.
# Hypoxia:
Serial CXRs showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Microbiology
as above. Patient arrived in the ICU unintubated but was
intubated on the day after transfer for increasing respiratory
effort and somnolence. She was sedated on fentanyl and versed
due to agitation and discomfort on the vent. She was difficult
to wean from 80% Fi02 and 14 PEEP. She required mechanical
ventilation at an Fi02 of 100% O2 until the time of expiration.
In addition to infection, there was concern for ARDS. The
patient expired on the ventilator.
.
#Pericardial Effusion: Admission CXR showed increased heart
size, and the echo done on [**2538-8-22**] showed increase in pericardial
effusion without evidence of tamponade. Patient's primary
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 205**] was alerted and recommended follow up
with echo on [**2538-8-25**]. Follow-up echo showed worsening
moderate-to-large pericardial effusion, which was drained by
bedside pericardiocentesis. Pericardial fluid included 30%
lymphocytes and 60% macrocytes, cultures negative. Although she
does not carry a diagnosis of cardiac GVHD, this was suspected.
A third follow-up echo showed normal LVEF.
.
#Congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction:
Patient has known CHF with systolic dysfunction from chemo, XRT
and suspected cardiac GVHD. Considered whether patient's recent
CHF lability might contribute to current respiratory acuity. She
was euvolemic to slightly volume up on exam with lower extremity
pitting edema. Daily weights showed her to be under her recent
discharge weight of 136.5 lb. She was on torsemide on arrival,
but this was held in the context of hypovolemia (see below).
NiCOM maneuvers were performed and a transesophageal Balloon was
placed for pleural pressure monitoring. Following
pericardiocentesis her cardiac output improved, repeat Echo was
performed, and congestive heart failure was thought not to be
the cause of her declining clinical picture. A repeat ECHO did
show worsening right ventricular function. Despite being on
three pressors, the patient's clinical picture declined and she
developed hypotension.

#Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient baseline creatinine 2.5 - 3.0
with admission Cr of 2.7. Creatinine continued to rise from 3.0
to 3.7 despite IVF. Renal service followed. Pt was hypocalcemic
to 5.9 (requiring standing supplementation) and
hyperphosphatemic, both likely secondary to renal failure. She
became anuric and was started on CVVHD. CVVHD was discontinued
as the patient developed hypotension despite being on three
pressors.
.
#ALL: Pt is s/p double cord blood SCT [**1-/2537**] complicated by
GVHD on immunosuppression, recently discharged on mycophenolate,
IV solumedrol and bactrim/acyclovir for prophylaxis. Her
mycophenolate dose was changed to 500 mg PO BID and she was
continued on this plus 60 mg IV solumedrol daily. She was on
Bactrim prophylaxis prior to admission, and this was increased
to therapeutic dosing while in the ICU.

#Hypotension. She was transiently IV fluid and pressor-dependent
with hypotension to 85/45 but maintained BP through most of her
ICU stay. Home nifedipine and lopressor were held.

#Anemia. Transfused 1U PRBC for Hct 22 on ICU day 2;
post-transfusion Hct 27.

# Hyponatremia. She was hyponatremic, likely due to diuresis
(which was stopped). No mental status changes prior to
intubation. Free water restricted.

# LFT abnormalities. Stable transaminases, with normal ALT and
AST mildly elevated. Unclear etiology, likely secondary to
hypoxia and end-organ underperfusion.

# Thrombocytopenia. Platelet count remained low but patient did
not show signs of coagulopathy.
