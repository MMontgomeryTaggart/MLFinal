Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11824**]
Chief Complaint:
bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pacemaker lead revision


History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old woman with known CHB, s/p dual chamber PPM in
[**2879**], generator change in [**2887**], with lead fracture noted prior
to the [**2887**] change, with placement of a second RV lead (old RV
lead left in place), now presents with bradycardia secondary to
failure of her RV lead to capture.

She presented to her PCP on the day of admission complaining of
gout pain in her left 3rd MCP. Her pulse was noted to be in the
30's and she was sent to the local ER and then to the [**Hospital1 18**]
device clinic. Interrogation demontstrated failure of the RV
lead to capture. Aside from mild fatigue over the past few weeks
the patient has been completely asymptomatic without dyspnea,
orthopnea, LE edema, or dizziness. She has a good appetite and
energy and has excellent funcitonal status, able to bathe, clean
and cook without limitation.

STUDIES:
ECG:
Complete heart block, narrow complex escape at 30 bpm, QT 660ms,
QTc ~500ms. Atrially sensed ventricular pacing spikes noted that
do not capture the ventricule. Intermittent a-pacing noted.

Chest x-ray ([**2893-4-29**]):
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Unchanged position of three pacemaker leads.
3. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.

Chest x-ray s/p ICD revision ([**2893-5-2**]):
A right-sided pacemaker is in place, with one right atrial and
two right
ventricular leads are present.  Curvilinear lucency seen along
the anterior mediastinum on the lateral view is thought to
represent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] artifact related to the patient's overlying the
humerus.  Allowing for this, no pneumothorax or
pneumomediastinum is detected.   A small left effusion is new
compared with [**2893-5-1**] at 18:37 p.m. Minimal left base
atelectasis is noted.Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified.Probable
background COPD.
IMPRESSION: New small left effusion.  Otherwise, no significant
change
compared with [**2893-5-1**].

ECHO ([**2893-5-3**]):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. Wire/catheter seen in RA and RV.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. No pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF CLINICAL SUMMARY:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 81 year-old woman with known complete heart
block s/p pacer placement in [**2870**]'s found to have asyptomatic
bradycardia secondary to malfunctioning pacer lead.  The
pacemaker lead was revised on [**2893-5-1**], with resolution of
bradycardia.
.
ISSUES:
# Complete heart block: Secondary to malfunctioning pacer lead.
Asyptomatic. Patient's heart rate in 30s-40s, with SBP in
190s-200s.  The patient was transiently treated with
isoproterenol and hydralazine to attempt to mitigate some of the
significant hypertension, prior to lead revision.  On [**2893-5-1**],
the patient underwent lead revision. The patient received
cefazolin for the first procedural day, then cefpodoxime for the
next 5 days s/p procedure. CXR confirmed correct lead placement.
Echo on [**2893-5-3**] demonstrated normal biventricular cavity sizes
with preserved global biventricular systolic function. No
pericardial effusion.
.
# Abdominal pain: Patient c/o epigastric pain s/p pacer
placement so bedside echo was obtained to r/o perf and showed no
effusion. Also checked LFTs, which were normal. Most likely
abdominal pain secondary to gas pain, resolved w/ administration
of simethicone. Discomfort resolved on discharge.
.
# HTN: Expected in setting of decreased HR. Asymptomatic without
evidence of end organ damage. SBP in 190s on floor even s/p lead
revision.  The patient most likely is hypertensive at home, as
the patient was noted to have poor compliance with medications
at home. On the floor, he was re-started on losartan 100mg
daily, started HCTZ 25mg daily, and carvedilol 40mg ER
multiphase 24 hr qd at bedtime. The patient will need close
blood pressure monitoring as an outpatient, with titration as
necessary.
.
# ?? Gout: Patient actually reports she has not had a flare in
weeks and has not been taking her colchicine or allopurinol. Her
joints are not hot or tender although there is some significant
crepitus and deformity in her left wrist and right knee. She is
afebrile without leukocytosis so no concern for septic joint at
this time. We restarted the patient's allopurinol and recommend
PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 695**] of her poly-articular joint pain.  The patient was
sent home with allopurinol and colchicine.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. follow-up in device clinic MONDAY [**2893-5-11**] at 10:00 AM
2. peri-procedural antibiotics: cefpodoxime  100 mg Tablet.  Two
(2) Tablets by mouth every 12 hours: Final day of therapy
[**2893-5-8**].
3. PCP f/u of gout and hypertension
4. [**Month (only) 115**] consider outpatient renal artery ultrasound for
refractory hypertension as an outpatient if HTN continues to be
difficult to manage

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **],

You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**]
for a low heart rate.  You had a procedure that repaired the
leads on  your pacemaker device. Your pacemaker was working well
upon your discharge. Your blood pressure is high so we have
adjusted your medicines to lower your blood pressure.

You should continue to take all of your home medications as you
previously had, except:

ADD cefpodoxime  100 mg Tablet.  Two (2) Tablets by mouth every
12 hours for 4 days: Final day of therapy [**2893-5-8**].

STOP Taking Toprol, take Coreg XR instead at bedtime for your
blood pressure

START taking Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for your blood pressure
