Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1130**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to LAD

History of Present Illness:
60-year-old female with HTN, hyperlipidemia, and multinodular
goiter who presented to the ED with progressive chest pains and
palpitations over the past 4 months.  She reports that she has
had intermittent chest pressures associated with palpitations
that usually last 2-3 minutes and occur mostly at rest. They are
not associated with exertion, and stressful/emotional situations
tend to exacerbate her symptoms. She was recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 2148**] over the weekend (although per ED resident, no record of
this at [**Hospital1 2148**]) with chest pains and, per pt, they wanted to do a
cardiac cath but she was not comfortable with the facilities
there. She presents here now with chest pressures and
palpitations since 5 AM this morning that woke her from sleep.
They are a bit more severe than usual, and have been
intermittent throughout the morning.  Patient also had excrcise
stress test in [**2642-9-15**] ischemic EKG changes in the absence of
anginal symptoms at a high cardiac demand good exercise
tolerance.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.0, HR 99, BP 159/81, RR 16,
and SpO2 100% on RA.  EKG showed SR at 72 bpm with NA, NI, and
TWI in III similar to prior EKG.  Initial Troponin was negative.
 Labs were otherwise unremarkable.  Cardiology consult was
called and recommended Aspirin 325 mg PO, Nitroglycerin SL PRN,
and urgent coronary catheterization.
.
Patient was taken directly to the cath lab, with no heparin.
Patient was loaded with prasugrel and started on integrillin. In
the cath lab patient was found to have single vessle CAD with
moderate LAD lesion at the takeoff of the D2.  The diag ostial
lesion was 80-90% stenosis.  She had successful POBA of the D2
and then successful stening of LAD with [**Date Range **].  During the
procedure patient became diaphoretic and dropped BPs to the
70-80s with HR in the 60s treated with atropine and rewuired
dopamine which was weaned off over few minutes with improvemnt
in BP to 110s-110s. Limited echo showed no effusion.  Patient
was admitted to CCU for monitoring.
.
In the CCU, patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath,
lightheadedness, dizziness, fevers. No diaphoresis or
nausea/vomiting. Also denies orthopnea, PND. All other ROS
negative.

Cath: [**2642-9-27**]:
1. Coronary angriography in this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel disease. The LMCA was a long vessel
with a 10% mid-vessel lesion. The LAD had mild luminal
irregularities proximally and 60% hazy mid vessel at the take
off of the D2. The D2 had an 80% ostial lesion. The distal LAD
was otherwise patent and long, wrapping around the apex. The LCx
had mild luminal irregularities and gave a large bifurcating OM
with relatively large upper and lower poles. The RCA was patent
with mild luminal irregularities.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left sided filling
pressures and mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension with
SBP 146 mmHg.
3. FFR of the LAD lesion 0.82 with [**Month (only) **] showing the MLA at
2.7-2.8m2
4. Successful POBA of D2
5. Succesful stenting of mid LAD with 3.0 x 12 [**Month (only) **]
6. Likely vagal reaction following LAD stenting requiring
fluids, atropine and transient dopamine infusion.
7. Non flow limiting dissection of D2 with antegrade flow.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease with moderate hazy mid LAD
lesion at the takeoff of the D2. D2 ostial lesion was 80-90%.
2. FFR of mid LAD lesion of 0.82 and [**Month (only) **] showing the LAD lesion
area of 2.7-2.8m2.
3. Successful POBA of D2 with 2.0mm balloon.
4. Succesful stenting of LAD with 3.0 X 12mm Promus element [**Month (only) **]
5. Vagal reaction following LAD stent post dilation treated with
atropine, fluids and brief dopamine gtt with normalization of
hemodynamics
6. Non flow limiting ostial D2 dissection with normal antegrade
flow
7. Closure of right radial artery access site with TR band.
.
CXR: [**2642-9-27**]
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 The heart is of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal
contours.  The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  The lungs
are clear without focal or diffuse abnormality.  No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.  Osseous structures are
unremarkable.  No radiopaque foreign body.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo F with HTN, hyperlipidemia presented with recurrent
progressively worsening chest pains with recent abnormal stress
test concerning for unstable angina and CAD. Negative troponins
and now s/p cath with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to LAD.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Patient presented with 3-4 months of
worsening chest pains at rest lasting 2-3 minutes.  Patient had
recent exercise tolerance test which showed ischemic EKG changes
without any symptoms.  ON the day of admission patient was
awakened by [**8-16**] constant chest pain.  In the ED, EKG showed
non-Specific ST changes, initial troponins were negative.  Given
concern fro unstable angina and CAD, patient had cardiac cath
which showed single vessel CAD with moderate LAD lesion at the
takeoff of the D2.  The diag ostial lesion had 80-90% stenosis.
She had successful POBA of the D2 and then successful stenting
of LAD with [**Month/Year (2) **].  During the procedure patient became
diaphoretic with drop in BP to 70s and HR 60s most likely vagal
reaction.  She was briefly on pressors for BP support. Post cath
EKG was essentially unchanged.  She was prasugrel loaded in the
cath lab and started on 18 hours of Integrilin.  She was
transferred to CCU for further hemodynamic monitoring.  During
her CCU stay her blood pressure stayed stable and she did not
have any chest pain or shortness of breath.  She was continued
on aspirin, valsartan, prasugrel.  Her simvastatin was changed
to atorvastatin.  She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for
further care who will make decision regarding patient's
anti-platelet therapy and getting a follow up TTE in one month.

.
# Hypertension: Patient was hypotensive in the cath lab
requiring atropine and dopamine.  Patient has remained stable in
the 120s-130s systolic in the CCU. She was discharged on her
home valsartan and HCT combination med.
- Continue HCTZ 12.5mg daily
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Her simvastatin was switched to atorvastatin
80mg daily
.
# Prediabetes: Patient blood sugars continued to be in the
120-130s.  Patient will follow up with PCP who will check an A1C
level.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 18670**],
It was a pleasure taking care of your during your
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].  You had a procedure to place a stent
in your heart because of your recurrent chest pains.  You did
not have a heart attack.  You were admitted to cardiac intensive
unit because of brief episode of low blood pressure during the
procedure.  You were monitored overnight in the cardiac
intensive unit and your blood pressures remained normal.  On the
day of discharge you did not have any chest pain or shortness of
breath.  Following your heart procedure you have been started on
a blood thinning medication called prasugrel which you should
continue to take for at least one year unless told otherwise by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  You should follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  (see
below) Your simvastain is also being replaced with atorvastain.
.
You can pick up your Prasugrel and atorvastatain medication from
CarePlus Pharmacy [**Hospital1 18671**]. Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18672**]
