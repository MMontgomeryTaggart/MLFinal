History of Present Illness:
47 yo male with HIV (last CD4 238, viral load 882 in [**12-18**]) on
HAART, DM, ESRD on HD, h/o PE on coumadin (dx [**7-18**]), h/o

this morning with L eye monocular blurry vision and
dysequilibrium with standing. When he first awoke, he was seeing
double, worse with R gaze. He also felt as though he was losing
his balance when standing, but thinks this is due to the double
vision in his L eye. He does have some mild pain in his L eye.

AM. He also has had a R temporal HA over the past week which is
not throbbing and fairly constant.  He rates this HA as [**10-21**],
but does not wish to take any pain medications for it. He denies
slurred speech, CP, SOB, abd pain, new weakness or numbness in
any of his extremities, BRBPR, diarrhea, constipation. He states
he has been compliant with taking all of his medications.

discontinued as his SBP was 140s.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo male with HIV (last CD4 238, viral load 882 in [**12-18**]) on
HAART, DM, ESRD on HD, h/o PE on coumadin (dx [**7-18**]), h/o
medication noncompliance, h/o malignant hypertension, who
presents with hypertensive urgency and left 3rd nerve palsy.
.
# Hypertensive Crisis:  Pt was admitted to the MICU.  This is
likely secondary to medication noncompliance given that pt's BP
rapidly normalized after pt received his home BP meds. Pt has
possible mild resultant cardiac ischemia from this event
(positive MB index). He has prior h/o malignant HTN in the past,
treated with nitro gtts and lebatolol gtts. Labetolol gtt was
d/c'd once pt came into MICU.  He was restarted on home
medications with few modificaitons and his BP has been
well-controlled.  He was continued on his home diovan 160 mg po
bid, nifedipine CR 60 mg daily, clonidine TTS 2 patch qSun,
Toprol XL 25 mg daily.  His lisinopril was increased from 10 mg
tid to 20 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Transient 3rd nerve palsy:  Neurology was consulted and felt
his vision changes were likely secondary to 3rd nerve palsy on
the L, which is usually caused by DM or HTN.  There was no
pupillary defect nor papilledema or hemorrhages on fundoscopic
exam.  Ophthomology also evaluated the pt and reported
resolution of the 3rd nerve palsy.  His vision changes had
resolved by discharge.  Pt will follow up with outpatient
ophthomology.
.
# Elevated cardiac enzymes:  With his elevated cardiac enzymes,
he was initially started on heparin gtt.  This was likely due to
leakage of enzymes from hypertensive emergency as opposed to
ischemic event.  His elevated Tpn is likely due to CRF. No had
no EKG changes.  CK plateaued at 139 and trended down.  Heparin
gtt was stopped given low suspicion and INR near therapeutic for
distant DVT.  He was continued on his aspirin.
.
# Hypoxia:  On admission he was hypoxic wtih mild wheezing at
lung bases, likely either [**2-12**] to atelectasis vs. volume overload
from hypertensive crisis.  CXR had no evidence of acute
cardiopulmonary process.  He was weaned to RA [**1-31**] without
desaturation and remained on RA for the remainder of his
hospitalization.
.
# N/V:  This was likely related to hypertensive crisis as it
resolved with BP control.  Amylase/lipase, LFTs were not
indicative of an acute processs.  His known gastroparesis may
have also contributed, and he was continued on his outpatient
regimen of Reglan.
.
# ESRD: Pt cont. to have hemodialysis qMWF.  He was continued on
lanthanum.
.
# HIV: He follow ups poorly with both Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 252**] (ID) and his PCP,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1549**].  Per ID, given his history of medical noncompliance,
his HAART medications were held.  He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 252**] as an outpatient regarding reinitiation of HAART.
.
# h/o PE: Pt was admitted with subtherapeutic INR of 1.3.  His
coumadin was increased to 5 mg daily and was therapeutic upon
discharge.
.
# ?Depression: Per his nephrologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] & PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1549**],
there has been some concern for worsening depression/coping,
which may be possibly contributing to his medical noncompliance.
 Psychiatry was consulted and felt that he did appear to be
somewhat dysthymic but without overt depressive symptoms.  Pt
denies any medical noncompliance.
.
# Restless leg syndrome:  Pt was continued on neurontin.
.
# DM: Pt was continued on home NPH and ISS with adqueate control
of BS.
.
# Code Status: Full
