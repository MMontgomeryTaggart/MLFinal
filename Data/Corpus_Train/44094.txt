Chief Complaint:
hypotension/bradycardia

Permanent pacemaker implant [**3261-2-28**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 22346**] is a 85M with PMH significant for cardiac amyloid,
dCHF (EF 55%), CKD (baseline Cr 2.0), afib (on coumadin) who has
been feeling more fatigued for past 2 weeks.  He has been
feeling more lightheaded the past few days.  He gets VNA care at
home, and VNA has been noticing BPs in the 80s. VNA was unable
to get BP today and found HR 40s-50s.  Baseline HR 30s-70s but
normally 60s.  Baseline BPs 100s-110s.  Upon questioning, he
endorses brief episode of left-sided chest pressure last night
that spontaneously resolved.  No radiation, diaphoresis, nausea.
 He has not had any symptoms of chest pain since then.  EMS
found him to be bradycardic at 40, with blood pressure cuff
[**Location (un) 456**] 40 over palp, however with palpable radial pulse and
mentating well.
.
Patient has never had problems with bradycardia or hypotnsion
before.  His CHF has been managed for years with diuresis,
complicated by CKD.  It is difficult to diurese him to dry
weight without cause acute on chronic renal failure.  Per
patient's nephrologist renal failure is likely multifactorial.
Hydronephrosis likely related to amyloid. Stage III CKI thought
to be related to htn, not from renal amyloid. He has not noticed
any overt bleeding recently.  He has not had bladder bleeding
for past 5 months.  He denies blood in his stools or dark tarry
stools.  No bloody emesis or hemoptysis.  He takes prednisone
for gout, but has not taken any prednisone for half a year.
.
In ED, he was found to be in a wide-complex afib in rate
20s-40s. BP: 40/palp, increased to 80/40, then to 100/40 w/o
intervention.  He denied CP/SOB.  He continues to be awake and
alert and mentating well. His hematocrit has dropped since
[**Month (only) 728**], and he does have guaiac positive brown stool. He did
not receive atropine.  He appeared dry on exam so received 1L
NS.  Vitals prior to transfer were: HR: 41, RR: 16, BP: 94/40,
O2Sat: 100%.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.  Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 22346**] is a 85M with
PMH of dCHF secondary to senile amyloid, hypertension, afib and
CKD who presents with bradycardia and hypotension, from which he
is relatively asymptomatic.

Active Diagnoses:
# Bradycardia: Patient arrived in afib with abberancy with rate
in the 20s-30s. He was monitored on telemetry and eventually
started on dopamine, which increased his HR.  Pacer pads were
placed, pacer at bedside, but were not necessary.  A pacemaker
was implanted on [**2-28**] and paced to rate in the 60s.  Patient was
started on toprol 12.5mg daily.  He was perfusing well and
maintaining a good heart rate with no PPM complications at the
time of discharge.

# Hypotension: Patient's blood pressure on presentation was in
the systolic 70s-80s.  He was asymptomatic and mentating well.
He was started on dopamine.  After PPM implantation, systolic BP
improved to 100s-110s.  Home torsemide, spironalactone, and
terazosin were initially held, but then resumed after blood
pressures normalized.  Toprol 12.5mg daily was also started.

# Acute systolic on chronic diastolic heart failure: Patient
appears euvolemic.  Patient has diastolic heart failure thought
to be secondary senile amyloid superimposed on his chronic
hypertensive heart disease.  Echo on [**3261-2-25**]: EF 40%, severe
tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary artery sytolic
hypertension.  Patient was discharged on Toprol 12.5mg daily,
spironalactone and torsemide 100mg daily.  His standing
metolazone order (twice/ week) was discontinued and patient will
follow up with outpatient cardiologist regarding any weight gain
and need for additional diuresis.  He will weigh himself at
home.  He was educated on a low sodium diet, fluid restriction,
daily weights, I+O's.

#Acute on Chronic renal failure: Baseline cr 2.0.  Renal failure
to 2.7 on presentation, thought to be secondary to hypertension
and amyloid, normalized to baseline by discharge.

# Anemia/Hct drop: Patient's baseline Hct is 42, but he was
admitted with Hct 29.8. Pt has been stable with Hct 26.8- 31.8,
no obvious signs of blood loss.  He was continued on iron
supplementation. He also had some mild hematuria, which was
monitored with no intervention.

# Dysuria, hematuria: pt complained of dysuria, found to have
mild gross hematuria. UA and UCx otherwise benign. He started
pyridium on AM of discharge to good effect, dysuria resolved. He
will complete 3 day course of pyridium 100mg PO TID on
discharge. If hematuria continues, he should see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22347**]
outpatient who will perform cystoscopy.
.
# Afib: Chronic, and on warfarin anticoagulation. INR elevated
on admission, so warfarin was held, but then resumed when he
became subtherapeutic.  He was on heparin sq for a few days when
subtherapeutic INR.  INR stabilized and patient restarted on
warfarin by discharge.

Chronic Diagnoses:
# HLD: Continued on home dose of simvastatin 10 daily.

# Gout: Continued febuxostat prophylaxis to increase urinary
secretion of uric acid and continued colchicine qod per home
regimen.

# BPH:  Terazosin was initially held in setting of hypotension,
but then restarted.

# Constipation: Patient was initially on senna and colace, but
had no BM in 5 days, so miralax was added, and patient had bowel
movement.

========================
Transitional Issues:

further cardiac management.
-He was educated on weighing himself and calling his
cardiologist for adjustments to his diuresis as needed.
-If hematuria continues, should see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22347**] (will do
cystoscopy)
-Pt restarted on home torsemide 100mg PO daily: please check

daily weights - if he's losing weight or looks dry, call his
cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7415**]
