History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 88 year old female with a history of aortic
stenosis who presented to an outside hospital on [**2998-11-5**] with
acute shorteness of breath. She was found to have acute
pulmonary edema thought to be secondary to dietary indiscretion,
aortic stenosis, and URI. She was found initially to have
hypertension treated with biPAP and lasix with improvement of
her breathing. While admitted the patient did have cardiac
enzyme elevation that was thought to be secondary to LV strain
rather than acute coronary syndrome. Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 4**],
the patient is asymptomatic. She had no shortness of breath,
chest pain, nausea or vomiting. She reported that she has had no
dyspnea in 12 hours and has been off 02 since arrival to [**Hospital1 4**].
She confirms that she had high salt intake prior to the
admission to the OSH but otherwise has had no change in her
medications or symptoms including no preceeding chest pain,
nausea or palpitations. ROS + for increasing cough without
sputum prior to admission negative except as above including no
bleeding, syncope, fatigue, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting


Past Medical History:
Chronic Diastolic Cardiac Dysfunction
Hypertension
Aortic stenosis
Dyslipidemia
Glaucoma
s/p appendectomy, left knee surgery, cataract surgery and
hysterectomy

[**2998-11-8**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
heavily calcified with an ostial stenosis of 40-50% and a distal
stenosis of 30-40%. The LAD was heavily calcified with a
proximal 30% stenosis and a mid 70% after the take off of a
modest D1. The LAD had diffuse disease in the mid to distal
portion of the vessel. The LCX was heavily calcified with
diffuse disease to 50% proximally with a mid stenosis of 60-70%
before an aneurysmal segment from which small OM3 and a large
OM4 arose. The OM5/LPL had a proximal tubular stenosis of 60%. A
small high OM1 has a moderate stenosis at its origin. The RCA
was heavily calcified with diffuse disease throughout to 60% mid
vessel. The RPDA had a proximal 70% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left
ventricuHg. There was mild systolic pulmonary artery pressures
with 32 mmHg. The cardiac index was normal at 2.3 L/min/m2.
There was mild systolic arterial blood pressure at 140 mmHg with
a systemic vascular resistance of [**2887**] dynes/s-1/cm-5. There was
severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 67 mmHg and a
calculated valve area of 0.5 cm2 (based on an assumed VO2 and an
UNDERESTIMATE in the setting of aortic regurgitation).
3. Left ventriculography showed a preserved ejection fraction at
71% with normal regional wall motion and a stroke volume index
of 49 mL/m2.

[**2998-11-9**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Less than 40% right ICA stenosis. 40-59% left ICA stenosis.

[**2998-11-9**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Moderate cardiomegaly with coronary artery and aortic
calcifications, as well as calcification of the aortic valve and
milder calcification of the mitral annulus. No evidence of acute
pulmonary infection or pulmonary edema. Small right greater than
left pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis
in the lower lobes. 2. Incidentally noted small pulmonary
nodules measuring up to 4 mm. In a patient without strong risk
factors for intrathoracic malignancy, no followup is recommended
per the [**Last Name (un) 1278**] guidelines.

MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17500**] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being AV paced.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the Aortic
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (peak gradient
= 15 mmHg). A trace perivalvular leak is seen.
2. Bi ventricular function is preserved.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. After massive transfusion, biventricular function is
preserved, but MR is now moderate and TR is now moderate
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted under the cardiology service and
underwent cardiac catheterization which confirmed severe aortic
stenosis and revealed three vessel coronary artery disease -
see result section for further detail. Based upon those results,
cardiac surgery was consulted and further preoperative
evaluation was performed. Preoperative workup consisted of
dental clearance, carotid ultraound and chest CT scan - see
result section for results.

The night before surgery, she became acutely short of breath and
devleoped respiratory distress. She was concomitantly
hypotensive at that time(attributed to Nitro). She required
intubation and was placed on Neosynephrine to maintain stable
hemodynamics. Following intubation, she transferred to the CCU.
Shortly thereafter, she was brought to the cardiac cath lab for
placement of an IABP. Following successfull placement of the
IABP, she was urgently brought to the operating room where Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 17500**] performed aortic valve replacement and coronary artery
bypass grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see
seperate dicatated operative note.

Following the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. The IABP was slowly
weaned and removed without complication on postoperative day
one. She maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the
SDU on postoperative day two.

Once on the floors she had an uneventful post-operative course.
Her activity level progressed slowly and on POD5 she was
discharged to rehabilitation.
