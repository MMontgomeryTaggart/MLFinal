Chief Complaint:  respiratory distress
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 468**] is a 74 yo woman with a history of ESRD on hemodialysis, DM,
   HTN, PVD, afib, and hyperlipidemia who presents to ED with respiratory
   distress. Of note, patient returned at 8:30pm after being discharged
   today at 7pm after an overnight admission in which she was treated for
   hypotension with dialysis which is a typical presentation for her on
   multiple admission in the past. Per report she was dialyzed 4.5L off.
   Her dialysis was stopped and she was given 800cc of IVF at dialysis and
   another 500cc in the ED. She was also found to have a supratherapeutic
   INR to 20 she was given 10mg PO VitK and her coumadin was held. This
   was thought to be [**1-20**] increased dose of amiodarone.
   .
   In the ED, thought to be in failure put on Bipap on OSH for sats in
   80s, still on Bipap. Renal said to consult in am. 70-80s, BP
   130-140s/60-80s sats 100% on [**9-22**] breathing at 20. CXR increased
   opacitiy at bases. EKG unchanged.
   .
   Currently, the patient was in no distress reporting that she felt 100%
   better than before.  She reported no feeling any respiratory symptoms
   at all.  She describes getting home and getting up to make a [**Location (un) 297**]
   and then becoming acutely SOB. She describes a feeling of increasing
   difficulty breathing and catching her breath. This was associated with
   some palpitations but no chest pain. She also denied fever, chills, and

   Assessment and Plan
    Ms. [**Known patient lastname 468**] is a 74 yo woman with a history of ESRD on hemodialysis,
   DMs, HTN, PVD, afib, and hyperlipidemia who presented to ED with
   respiratory distress after a discharge earlier in the day.
   # Hypoxia/respiratory distress: Likely [**1-20**] to underdiuresis on monday
   prior to admission and then subsequent IVF she received resulting an
   acute pulmonary edema. She does have a history of dCHF and clinically
   the story fits. She improved dramatically on Bipap. Ischemia should be
   ruled out but also unlikely given lack of chest pain or EKG changes.
   Other etiologies of acute dyspnea include PE which in unlikely as she
   was therapeutic on coumadin. She is also in sinus although Paroxsymal
   burst of Afib might have thrown her into failure. In addition, has
   history of COPD but unlikely this is a flare given quick resolution
   without inhalers/steroids/antibiotics. Also less likely is pna given
   lack of fever ior clincal symptoms.
