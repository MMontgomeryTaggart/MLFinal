   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Continue spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrate to 25mg daily in the
   next day
   - Stop lasix drip
   - Restart home dose of torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**8-24**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema, will plan to increase to 25 TID on [**8-27**].
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Decrease ASA to 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  Coumadin re-started yesterday, on Heparin drip.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**8-23**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft)
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia: stable, chronic.  Transfusion not indicated at this time.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**8-11**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**8-12**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   -continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - D/C Percocet
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Re-start Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 56**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:  Repleted with small amt of K given lasix gtt and
   decline in K.  Expect to stabilize with discontinuation of lasix gtt
   and spironolactone.
