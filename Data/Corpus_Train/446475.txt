   Assessment and Plan
 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, SUSTAINED
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   81 yr old M with a PMH of CAD, three vessel disease s/p MI and CABG in
   [**2751**] and subsequent LAD stenting in [**2772**] complicated by ventricular
   aneurysms and tachycarrhythmias, chronic a. fib, systolic CHF with EF
   of 25% s/p single chamber ICD presents with electric shock-like pain in
   his chest. Patient had VT storm and required pressor support during
   ablation and has been admitted to CCU for further monitoring.
   .
   # Rhythm: Patient has [**Company **] teligen single chamber ICD.
   Past week patient had recurrent ICD firing. Admitted to EP/[**Hospital1 2208**] service
   for VT ablation today ([**9-16**]). Prior to procedure patient went into
   recurrent VT leading to multiple ICD shocks. He was loaded with
   intravenous lidocaine with partial success. During the procedure
   patient required neosinephrine and dopamine to support his blood
   pressure. Underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation.
   - Increase Toprol XL to 75 mg qd
   - Initiate quinidine 324 mg TID
   - Magnet by bed-side in case repetitive firing, consider lidocaine
   - Resume heparin in morning
   - Re-start coumadin (for a fib)
   - Tele
   - Monitor closely overnight
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure: ECHO this admission demonstrates EF 30%.
   Patient appears euvolemic on exam.
   - continue digoxin 0.125 mcg daily, lasix 80mg PO daily, eplerenone
   25mg PO daily, metoprolol.
   .
   # CAD:
   - MI complicated by ventricular aneurysm and tachyarrhythmias
   - three vessel CABG in [**2751**], and subsequent LAD stenting in [**2772**]
   - continue outpatient aspirin 81mg PO daily, losartan 50mg daily,
   simvastatin 40mg PO daily
   - follow daily EKG
   .
   # Chronic Atrial Fibrillation: Rate regular, well controlled.
   - beta blocker for rate control
   - re-started coumadin
   - re-start heparin bridge in am
   .
   # DMII: hold amaryl while inpatient
   - sliding scale
   .
   # chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine 1.8. Improved from baseline
   of 2.
   - trend renal function daily
   .
   # HTN: blood pressures well controlled during admission
   - continue toprol XL 50mg daily
   .
   # Gout: continue allopurinol 100mg PO BID
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: cont levothyroxine 100mcg daily
   .
   FEN: Diabetic, heart healthy
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -GI ppx with ranitidine.
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots/heparin gtt
   -Pain management with tylenol.
   -Bowel regimen with senna/colace.
