   Imaging: [**11-7**] CXR:  (my read)  left whiteout largely unchanged.  right
   hilar fullness slightly worse.
   [**11-6**] TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate
   global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %). The right
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 87 yoM with cardiac history as well as squamous cell
   on face, admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum
   production and white out of left lung.
   .
   #. UNILATERAL EFFUSION: less likely CHF b/c of left-sided unilateral
   nature, though appears to have element of volume overload;
   parapneumonic effusion most likley, and would consider post-obstructive
   PNA given degree to which whole lung is affect and smoking history
   (thought had a normal PE four days ago at PCP's office per the pt).
   Also with question of hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (esp
   with the hypoxia).  s/p thoracentesis.   IP evaluated patient and
   recommended VATS, which the patient refused.
   -- D/C azithro/ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP
   -- Start Vanc/Cefepime for HAP
   -- f/u blood cultures, ucx
   -- will order TTE
   -- will obtain CT chest to evaluate for empyema, complicated effusion,
   etc.
   -- consult IP re: pleurocentesis of loculated effusion
   .
   #. COPD/ASTHMA: not sure which diagnosis he carries; records in
   computer incomplete
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- nebs prn
   .
   #. AFIB:  Back in a fib with RVR
   -- rate better now after fluids in ED
   -- Diltiazem drip for rate control
   -- not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- start ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   #. PPX: home PPI, SQH, bowel reg PRN
   .
   #. CONTACT: with patient, had friends who are [**Name (NI) 10876**] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 15**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 464**] and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10877**])
   .
   #. CODE: full, confirmed with patient, though he admits he hasn't
   really thought of it before.
   .
   #. DISPO: to remain in ICU overnight for obs, will call out if able to
   wean from O2 and stable
