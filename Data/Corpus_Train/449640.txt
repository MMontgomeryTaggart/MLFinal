   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   This is a 70 year-old male with a history ofIDDM, PVD s/p L BKA, h/o of
   TIA, CAD s/p stent in [**2553**], s/p PPM for asystole, HTN, HLD, neurogenic
   bladder with self catherization, peripheral neuropathy initially
   presented to [**Hospital1 17**] with urospesis and c/b stroke and coffee ground
   emesis.
   .
   Plan:
   #. UGIB: Pt with multiple episodes of coffee ground emesis. Pt has had
   nausea and episodes of vomiting intermittently prior to and during
   admission. No h/o NSAID or prior UGIB. Pt with prior EGD [**12/2563**] that
   was negative. Pt with coffee ground with lavage that cleared after
   800cc. Likely [**Doctor First Name 230**]-[**Last Name (un) **] tear in the setting of multiple episodes of
   vomiting.  Also on the differential include PUD and less likely
   malignancy, varices or AVM.  Hct has trended down from 37 to 32, but
   stable over the last 6 hrs.
   - IV PPI
   - 2 large bore IV
   - T&X 2 Units
   - q8 Hct checks
   - monitor hemodynamcis
   - NPO
   - GI consult in AM for EGD
   - zofran prn
   - guaiac stools
   - Fe studies
   .
   #. Stroke: Pt with acute onset of left sided neglect, left facial
   weakness that is resolving. Evaluated by neurology and lesion likely
   localizes to the right parietal lobe. CT-head negative. Unable to
   obtain MRI given PPM.
   - repeat CT head  in AM
   - holding Plavix for now given UGIB
   - fasting lipid profile and HgbA1C
   - TTE to r/o any new embolic source
   - telemetry
   - allow BP to autoregulate SBP <180
   - Gentle hydration with isotonic fluids
   - Keep HOB < 30 degrees to maximize cerebral perfusion
   - neuro checks q2
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   #. Pyleo: Pt with + UA and h/o UTI. Pt with recurrent fever and mild
   leukocytosis. Pt previously grown acinetobaceter and pseudomonas that
   was pansensitive. No evidence of pneumonia or intraabdominal infection
   currently.
   - cont IV Ceftriaxone
   - f/u Urine culture and sensi
   - obtain blood culture
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - tylenol prn
   .
   #. CAD: Pt with compliants of nausea/vomiting. Likely [**1-14**] to pyelo, but
   could be anginal equivalent. Although CE neg x3. Pt with unchanged ECG
   from admission, but ST changes when compared to prior, although
   difficult given v-pacing.
   - ECG in AM
   - recheck CE in AM
   - holding ASA and plavix given GI bleed
   - increase simvastatin to 80mg
   .
   #. Diabetes/Hyperglycemia:
   - QACHS FS and ISS
   - 17U NPH per home regimen, but will decrease by [**12-14**] when NPO
   - check a1c
   .
   #. BKA: wound clean and will continue routine care
   .
   #. HL: will add on fasting lipids and will increase simvastatin to
   80mg.
   .
   FEN: IVF, NPO
   .
   # Access: 2 PIV
   .
   # PPx: no heparin given HIT and GI bleed. pneumoboots

   # Code: FULL code (discussed with wife)
   .
   # Dispo: ICU for now pending above
