History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is an 81F with a history of schizoaffective disorder
and multiple comorbidities who was admitted to the medical
service s/p fall in the setting of hypotension and abdominal
pain. Prior to presentation, patient stated that she was having
rectal pain, increasing abdominal girth, and intermittent
abdominal pain. She also reports episodes of bilious vomiting
over the last year with dark stools. She has had weight loss of
unknown quantity which she attributes to poor appetite.

On admission, patient was not found to have any injuries but did
have a CT scan showing a new rectal mass, pancreatic tail mass
that is increased in size, and multiple pulmonary nodules. Her
CT also showed mild small bowel thickening with possible
thickening consistent with gastroenteritis or ischemia.
Patient's abdominal pain had largely resolved at that point, so
she was kept NPO, hydrated with IV fluids, and serially
examined. Lactate trended down from 2 to 1.2. Patient was seen
by gastroenterology for visceral masses and an NGT was placed.
Tube put out 850 cc of feculent appearing material over 24
hours.

On the day the surgical consult was placed, she began to
complain of worsening right sided abdominal pain. She has had
low grade tachycardia with moderate urine output (275 for 18
hours today). Her acute kidney injury has worsened. Surgery was
consulted after repeat CT showed worsened small bowel thickening
and interloop fluid. She currently complains of significant
nausea and abdominal pain.

Past Medical History:
Diabetes, Schizoaffective disorder, COPD, HTN, CAD,
Hypercholesterolemia, GERD, h/o head injury @ age 11

Past Surgical History:
Perforated duodenal ulcer in [**2670**] s/p cholecystectomy, anterior
parietal cell vagotomy, and [**Location (un) **] patch closure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Social History:
She denies alcohol and tobacco use. Never married. Patient has a
sister with whom she has not spoken for several years.


Family History:
Sister has history of breast cancer

STUDIES
EKG
Baseline artifact. Probable sinus tachycardia with a single
ventricular premature beat. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the
previous tracing of 11 [**10-19**] the rate is faster. Ventricular
premature beat is new. ST-T wave abnormalities are new. Clinical
correlation is suggested.
.
FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size. The aortic arch is partly
calcified. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. Cholecystectomy clips project over
the right upper quadrant.
.
CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2675-3-2**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute disease.
.
1. Borderline dilated loops of fluid-filled small bowel with
trace inter-loop fluid in the mesenteric root, which is
non-specific. A few loops of small bowel in the pelvis have
bowel wall thickening. While this can be seen in
gastroenteritis, the history of hypotension raises the
possibility of a low-flow bowel ischemia. No pneumatosis or free
intraperitoneal air. There are extensive atherosclerotic
calcifications in the aorta and its branches without obvious
arterial thrombus. No bowel obstruction.
2. No evidence of colitis. Normal appendix.
3. Eccentric wall thickening in the right posterior rectum.
Correlate with
rectal exam. Consider colonoscopy if clinically warranted.
4. Pancreatic tail cystic lesion is unchanged from [**Month (only) 435**]
[**2674**], but has
increased in size from [**2670**], again raising the possibility of
neoplasm.
5. 4mm right lower lobe nodule unchanged from [**2674-12-17**]. The
other pulmonary nodules seen on the prior CT are not included on
this study and follow is recommended per the [**2674-12-17**] report.
.
CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**2675-3-5**]
1. Dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.8 cm,
relatively
transitioning to normal caliber in the ileum. Worsening
concentric wall
thickening in the distal ileum and ascending colon, highly
concerning for
bowel ischemia, likely resulting in a non-mechanical SBO.
2. Eccentric wall thickening in the right posterior rectum and
pancreatic
tail cystic lesion, are similar to the prior study and need
further
evaluation.

CT Head [**2675-3-12**]:
No acute intracranial process. If clinical concern for
intracranial mass or stroke is high, MRI is more sensitive.

EEG [**2675-3-11**]:
Abnormal EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the
background, bursts of generalized slowing, and occasional left
frontocentral sharp waves. The first two abnormalities signify a
widespread encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances,
and infections are among the most common causes. The bifrontal
sharp waves indicate an area of cortical hypersynchrony. There
were no repetitive discharges to suggest ongoing seizures.

CXR [**2675-3-25**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the left pigtail
catheter
has been removed. There is no evidence of recurrent pleural
effusion.
Remnant basal atelectasis at the left lung base. No evidence of
pneumothorax.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, improvement in lung
transparency of the right lung, presumably reflecting improved
ventilation. Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube and of the
right PICC line.


Brief Hospital Course:
                        ** PRIOR TO SURGICAL INTERVENTION **
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted from the ED to the medical service for
management of her abdominal pain and hypotension. Her hospital
course from [**2675-3-2**] to [**2675-3-5**] is described below by problem:

# ABDOMINAL PAIN- On admission patient was noted to have diffuse
lower abdominal pain with associated abdominal distension.
Initial CT demonstrated some small bowel thickening which was
non specific and consistent with gastroenteritis versus ischemia
from a low flow state from her recent hypotension. Dilated loops
of bowel were present but there was no clear transition point
which was suggestive of ileus. There were no signs of colitis.
The patient was kept NPO and started on IVF for hydration in
addition to a bowel regimen.  She was noted to be passing gas
and had one large bowel movement which was guaiac positive. GI
was consulted and recommended NG decompression in addition to
initiation of cipro and flagyl.  Pain initially improved with NG
decompression but subsequently worsened prompting repeat CT
which showed worsened small bowel thickening and interloop
fluid.  Surgery was consulted given concern for obstruction and
mesenteric ischemia.
.
# HYPOTENSION- Patient was initially hypotensive in the
emergency department with SBP in the 70s.  Blood pressure
improved with administration of IVF and remained stable on
admission to the floor. Her anti-hypertensives including
lisinopril and diltiazem were initially held. She was however
continued on her home metoprolol. As below diltaizem was
restarted on HD 1 for heart rate control.
.
# RECTAL MASS- CT was concerning for rectal wall thickening.
This had been present in [**2674-12-8**] but not in [**2670**]. Rectal
exam was notable for a soft mildly tender mass.  GI was
consulted as above and recommend flexible sigmoidoscopy for
biopsy once the patient was clinically improved.
.
# PANCREATIC MASS- Patient noted to have a cystic lesion in the
pancreatic
tail unchanged from a CT done in [**12-20**] but new increasing in
size from [**2670**]. This was not further evaluation on this
hospitalization given the patients acute illness.  She will need
a MRCP for further evaluation
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION- Patient has a known history of post
operative atrial fibrillation.  On HD 1 she was noted to have a
fib with RVR with rates transiently to the 150s.  Blood remained
stable and the patient was asymptomatic. On admission she was
continued on her home metoprolol but diltiazem was held given
hypotension.  This medication was restarted on HD at a decreased
dose with improvement in rate control.
.
# ACUTE on CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE- Patients creatinine was
elevated from her baseline of 1.4 to 1.6 on admission.  This was
felt to likely be pre-renal in etiology as creatinine improved
to baseline with administration of IVF.  On HD 3 creatinine
trended upward to 2.0 and urine output decreased suggesting poor
renal perfusion.
.
STABLE ISSUES
# COPD- Patient was continued on her home regimen
# ANEMIA- Patients HCT was at baseline throughout admission.
# CAD- Patient was continued on her home beta blocker and
aspirin
# GERD- Patient was continued on omeprazole
# DM- Patients home glyburide was held and she was maintained on
a ISS
#Schizoaffective disorder- Patient was continued on seroquel

                          ** AFTER SURGICAL ASSESSMENT **
Surgical consultation was requested on [**2675-3-5**] and exam was
consistent with peritonitis. She was taken to the OR emergently
for exploratory laparotomy where a closed loop obstruction was
discovered with ischemic small bowel. After resection and
primary anastomosis, she was brought to the ICU intubated and on
pressors. Her postop course was complicated by a wound infection
and anastomotic leak requiring return to the OR for additional
resection and repeat anastomosis. Her course is described below
by system:

Neuro: With weaning of sedation, patient became agitated with
possible myoclonic jerks of her lower extremities. Neurology was
consulted and Head CT showed no abnormalities. EEG showed
diffuse slowing and no evidence of ongoing seizures. After
extubation, she was conversant with no major neurologic deficit.

CV: Her pressors were weaned off following aggressive fluid
resusitation. Echo performed on POD 3 showed good systolic
function and adequate volumes. She was also in afib with RVR.
Control was attempted with diltiazem drip, however she became
hypotensive. Patient was loaded with digoxin and given
intermittent metoprolol with good rate control. Once
hemodynamically stable, she was diuresed with lasix to good
effect, however a rising Creatinine limited the ability to push
her diuresis. Given her inability to take PO digoxin, her A-fib
was managed with IV metoprolol. As she remained in A-fib, a
heparin drip was initiated with transitioning to coumadin
beginning [**3-24**].

Resp: Patient was difficult to wean from the vent due to
underlying COPD and fluid overload. Her nebulizers were
continued and she was weaned to extubation on [**2675-3-15**] (POD [**11-8**]).
She displayed bilateral pleural effusions which were resistant
to medical diuresis, so bilateral chest tubes were placed which
each drained several liters of transudate prior to being removed
HD 22 and 24. A post pull chest x-ray on [**3-25**] revealed no
reaccumulation of pleural effusions and remnant basal
atelectasis on the left. She was restarted on home inhalers
while.

GI: Patient's wound developed erythema on POD#3 for which
patient was started on cefazolin. The following day her wound
was opened and culture grew MRSA so vanco was added to the
regimen. Erythema resolved and a wound vac was placed on [**2675-3-12**].
By POD 9 from her first ex-lap, she developed increasing
abdominal pain and fever and was found to have an anastomic leak
in the small bowel. She returned to the operating room [**2675-3-14**]
for another ex-lap with small bowel resection and primary
anastamosis. Given the re-operation and re-anastomosis, her
progress to PO intake was slow. A CT abdomen [**3-22**] confirmed no
anastomotic leak. Her tube feeds were advanced to goal.
Initially, high residuals were noted with tube feeds, and they
were held and slowly restarted.

GU/FEN: After surgery, patient's Cr normalized with excellent
urine output. She was intermittently oliguric (never less than
10-15 cc/hr) though typically had good urine output. She did
respond to lasix, however, a gradually rising Cr (1.3 on POD #2)
limited our ability to diurese her. She was given acetazolamide
for several days, then returned to lasix as needed.  She was
given TPN for supplemental nutrition while awaiting return of
bowel function. She should have TPN continued until able to
tolerate tube feeds.

Heme: Patient was transfused 1U of blood on POD#0. Her Hct was
stable and she was given heparin sc for DVT prophylaxis, then
heparin drip while transitioning to coumadin.

ID: Prior to her anastamotic leak, she was on vancomycin for her
wound infection. Following discovery of the leak and subsequent
OR, her coverage was broadened to Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl. The
vancomycin was DC'd [**3-18**] following treatment of her MRSA wound
infection.  The cipro and flagyl were continued for a total 14
day course after her reoperation.

Social: Patient has had a healthcare proxy (her sister) who no
longer functions as one, therefore steps were taken to establish
Guardianship for medical decision making.
