Chief Complaint:
Increased lower extremity edema and change in mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 yo female with a history of dementia, htn,
hypothyroidism, TIA ([**9-29**]) who is being transferred to the CCU
for hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.  She was
initially admitted overnight on [**8-15**] to the general medicine
service.  She presented from a long term care facility with
increased confusion and new lower extremity edema.  Her
daugheter expressed that her mother had decreased appetite and
confusion over the last 10 days.  Doctors at [**Name5 (PTitle) **] nursing home
started her on Remeron.  Per her nursing facility records she
gained 10 lbs in 2 days.  Presumably for this reason she was
referred for a cardiology evaluation (appt scheduled with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 205**] [**8-22**].)  However, she became increasingly confused and
unable to take [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was referred to [**Hospital1 4**] ED.
.
In the ED, VS: 96.4 73 123/91 18 97% on 4L. Patient agitated and
given haldol 5mg IV x 1. She also received 1mg IV ativan prior
to CT head which was negative. A CXR showed bilateral pleural
effusions L>R and moderate pulmonary edema.  ECG was read as
unchanged from prior tracing [**9-29**]. Troponin was .29, rising to
0.36. BNP was >8000.  Cardiology was consulted and felt this
troponin bump most likely attributed to heart failure rather
than ACS. Patient admitted to medicine for further work-up of
CHF.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient had a 4 L O2 requirement and
appeared volume overloaded.  ABG 7.44/73/32 on 4L.  She was
given 80 mg IV lasix, after which she made 700 cc urine within 1
hour.  SBP fell from baseline 140s to a low of 67.  Her mental
status continued to be arousable but drowsy.  She was given ~100
cc NS and SBP rose into the 80s.  Notably,  her respiratory
status apparently improved and O2 Sats rose to upper 90s on 4L.
.
There was suspicion for pulmonary embolism as a cause of her
hypoxia.  CT for PE could not be done secondary to poor renal
function.  Echocardiocardiogram was done to evaluate for signs
of R heart strain, and indeed demonstrated severe RV dilatation
and abnormal septal motion consistent with RV pressure/volume
overload new compared to prior echo 10/[**3293**]. PA pressures could
not be estimated.  Small pericardial effusion was also noted.
Heparin gtt without initial bolus was started for empiric
treatment of PE.
.
The patient's urine output trailed off to ~15cc/h, her SBP
remained in the 80s, and her mental status continued to be
suboptimal.  Thus, transfer to the CCU was initiated for workup
of new RV dilatation, apparent R sided heart failure, further
diuresis in the setting of borderline hypotension and preload
dependence, and altered mental status.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient was initially lethargic and could
provide only limited information.  She denied any difficulty
breathing or chest pain.  She further denied nausea or abdominal
pain.  Her only complaint is feeling extremely cold.

STUDIES:
ECG [**3295-8-15**]:
Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial abnormality. Indeterminate
axis. There is an SI-Q3-T3 pattern. Modest right ventricular
conduction delay pattern. Delayed R wave progression with late
precordial QRS transition. Diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Findings are non-specific but clinical correlation is suggested
for possible right ventricular overload. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**3294-10-17**] findings as outlined are now
present.

ECHO [**3295-8-16**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. Right ventricular
regional function cannot be assessed. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The supporting structures of the
tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is at least
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe right ventricular
dilation. Abnormal septal motion consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. Pulmonary pressures cannot
be adequately assessed. Preserved global systolic function.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3294-10-18**],
severe right ventircular dilation is now present. The right
ventricle appears to have been mild to moderately dilated on
prior study, but views were limited.

CXR [**3295-8-16**]:
AP chest compared to [**8-16**], 3:46 a.m., heterogeneous
bibasilar opacification has worsened. In the setting of
progressive moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and upper lobe
vascular engorgement, this is most readily explained by
dependent pulmonary edema, but pneumonia particularly aspiration
could be contributing. Bilateral pleural effusion is at least
small. Leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet
developed since [**3294-9-22**] could be due to progressive
tortuosity of the innominate artery or interval development of a
space-occupying lesion, most commonly a goiter but not
necessarily benign. When feasible, clinical evaluation is
recommended.

CXR [**3295-8-17**]:
Opacification at the lung bases is improving and moderate
cardiomegaly may have improved as well all pointing toward
decreasing cardiac decompensation and improving pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions persist left greater than
right. The greater extent of opacification at the left lung base
makes pneumonia a possibility. Leftward displacement of the
trachea at the thoracic inlet points to a space occupying lesion
such as a goiter, but requires evaluation since this is a new
finding since [**3294-9-22**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was paged.

EKG [**3295-8-18**]:
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous
tracing of [**3295-8-17**] ventricular ectopy is resolved.

CTA Chest [**3295-8-18**]: Dilatation of the right atrium, ventricle,
and pulmonary artery with filling defect in the main pulmonary
artery which extends into the left pulmonary arteries. There is
also bowing of the interventricular septum suggesting right
heart strain. This filling defect in the pulmonary artery could
represent a saddle embolism, however, due to the increased
density of contrast and early bolus timing, mixing artifact in
the pulmonary artery should also be considered. The case was
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a decision to anticoagulate and
repeat the study at a later date was planned due to elevated
creatinine.
Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo female with dementia (AAO x [**12-24**]), CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**1-30**],
TIA in [**9-29**], hypothyroidism, stable meningioma p/w increased
lethargy, weight gain, and LE edema, hypoxic to 94% 4L on
presentation found to be in acute right sided diastolic failure
secondary to pulmonary embolism.

1. Acute diastolic right heart failure: On [**Name (NI) **], pt with severe
RV dilatation new since [**9-29**], at least borderline PA systolic
HTN, and nl LVEF. LENIs negative and subsequent CTA equivocal
(saddle-embolic v. mixing artifact w/ suboptimal study) but
submassive-massive subacute PE most likely etiology of RV
failure; LV failure may have been due to RV impingement of LV
filling. Pt was started on heparin for treatment of PE, and
later transitioned to warfarin 5mg with lovenox bridging.
Lovenox was discontinued on [**8-22**] given supratherapeutic INR of
3.2, and warfarin held [**8-22**] and restarted at 2.5mg on [**3295-8-23**].
Pt's INR to be monitored at longterm nursing facility with goal
INR [**1-25**]. She will likely require at least a one-year course of
anticoagulation given her degree of cardiac impairment, with the
duration to be weighed against the risk of bleed. Her ASA was
decreased to 81mg daily given starting of warfarin.

2. Left heart failure: Pt fluid overloaded on presentation. [**Month/Day (3) **]
showed nl EF although some degree of diastolic dysfunction was
suspected. It was postulated that RV dilatation have been
impinging on LV filling and forward flow due to the septal wall
motion abnormality observed. Pt was transferred to CCU initially
as she became hemodynamically unstable in the setting of
diuresis, likely due to her preload dependence. In the CCU, she
was first diuresed with a furosemide drip, then transitioned to
IV boluses and with good effect. She was transferred back to the
floor after ~2.5L diuresis with stable BP and O2 sats 90-94% RA.
She appeared to have improving forward flow and on discharge,
O2sat 93% on RA and furosemide requirement 20 mg PO daily, with
possibility of weaning patient off furosemide in outpatient
setting. Patient did have some desaturation to 80s% during
night, possibly OSA, but CPAP would not be tolerated due to her
dementia.
.
3. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9. On admission,
it was 1.3, reaching a peak of 1.4 in the CCU. This was thought
secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF. This
improved back to baseline with diuresis. She did receive
Mucomyst for her CTA chest, and all of her medications were
renally dosed.
.
4. Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 974**] level of
consciousness on admission as well as intermittent
disorientation. This was likely secondary to medication effect
from ativan and haldol received in the ED as well as due to
acute illness including hypoxia and hypotension. CT head
negative; urine culture negative, and blood cultures with no
growth; TFTs nl; electrolytes nl; BUN elevated but not frankly
uremic level. Her Remeron (started recently for anorexia) was
held. Her mental status significantly improved within 48 hrs
with pt becoming more animated and interactive although she was
unable to state the season, DOB, and where she currently
resides.  She did have several nights of agitation requiring
soft restraints and IV Haldol, but 2 nights before discharge,
patient slept through the night and did not require chemical or
mechanical restraints. Patient was oriented x1 by discharge,
which appears to be similar to baseline dementia.
.
5. Anorexia: Daughter and HCP reported declining ability to take
PO. Possibly secondary to worsening dementia vs. subacute
medical illness. Remeron was recently started for this, unclear
if this had been helpful.  As mentioned above her Remeron was
held since it was thought to possibly be contributing to her
change in mental status.  A nutrition consult was requested, and
they recommended low sodium diet of pureed solids, thin liquids,
and Ensure supplements. Because the patient did not consistently
finish PO meals, nutrition recommended 1584 Kcal/70g protein
tube feeds at 55 ml/hr if it was consistent with the patient's
goals of care. The patient's guardian [**Name (NI) 3436**] [**Name (NI) 25400**] stated that
tube feeds were not desired at this time. A speech and swallow
consult was sought since patient has dementia and is at risk for
aspiration. We encourage supervised feedings once the patient
returns to her nursing home.
.
6. Bradycardia: Pt had been on metoprolol per NH records
although this had been discontinued per her most recent PCP note
in [**10-30**] due to possible role in TIA. She also had been noted to
have asymptomatic episodes of bradycardia to 30s in the past
which were also observed on this admission. For these reasons,
her metoprolol was once again discontinued on this admission.
