   [**3429-10-30**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
   the body of the left atrium. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of
   the left atrium. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). There is normal right ventricular free wall contractility.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve shows
   characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is moderate valvular mitral
   stenosis (mean gradient, 8 mmHg). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Repeat ECHO: pending
   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo gentleman with PMH significant for CVA, B-cell non-hodgkin's
   lymphoma, chronic afib on anticoagulation, s/p elective valvuloplasty
   for mitral stenosis.
   .
   #: MITRAL STENOSIS: Patient s/p mitral valvuloplasty without
   complication. Gradient significantly reduced post-intervention.
   -- Post cath check
   -- Monitor for evidence of embolization
   -- ECHO in AM.
   .
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Continue rate control and IV heparin for
   systemic anticoagulation.
   -- resume warfarin and heparin 4 hrs after sheath pull
   -- currently rate controlled off agents, will monitor
   .
   # PUMP: Normal systolic function. PCWP elevated pre-intervention,
   expect diminished post.
   .
   # Wt Loss: Concern for progression of his lymphoma vs deconditioning
   and poor PO intake in the setting of his valvular dysfunction.
   -valvuloplasty as above
   -will attempt to obtain outside heme/onc notes today
   .
   # Hx B-cell lymphoma: s/p chemo/radiation/diverting colostomy.
   .
   # Hx seizures: no recent seizure activity
   -- continue depakote
   .
   # Depression: continue fluoxetine
   .
   FEN:  Regular diet
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, venous and arterial sheaths to be pulled later
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin IV
   -Pain management with tylenol prn
   -Bowel regimen
