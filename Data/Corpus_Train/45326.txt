glucagon 5 mg IV x1. She was also given Dextrose 50%, and
combivent nebs. 1.5 L of NS were given.

.
[**7-18**] CT head w/o contrast:
IMPRESSION: No mass effect or hemorrhage
.
[**7-18**] CXR
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph reviewed. The
lung volumes are low. There is diffuse opacification of both
lungs with more dense bilateral retrocardiac opacities. The hila
are hazy and the pulmonary vasculature are engorged. The left
costophrenic angle is not sharp and a small left pleural
effusion on this poor quality radiograph cannot be excluded.

IMPRESSION: Moderate CHF.
.
[**7-19**] Renal U/S no hydronephrosis
.
[**7-19**] CT C/T/L spine without contrast
FINDINGS: The study is severely limited due to patient body
habitus and a mild amount of motion artifact. Cord compression
cannot be excluded based on non-contrast study. Within the
limitations of the artifact, there are no large displaced
fractures. There is a large amount of degenerative change. At
C2-3, [**2-19**], there is no spinal canal stenosis.

At C5-6, there is a small posterior osteophyte with mild spinal
canal stenosis. There is a large osteophyte at the right side of
the vertebral body. C5-6, there is a moderate sized posterior
osteophyte which appears to cause at least a moderate spinal
canal narrowing. There are osteophytes at both uncovertebral
joints.

At C6-7, there is a small posterior osteophyte present. This
causes no significant canal narrowing.

As the patient's body habitus produces significant artifact
within the spinal canal, a disc or rather soft tissue masses
could easily cause spinal cord compression would not be
visualized on this study. An alternative way to evaluate the
central canal would be to obtain a CT myelogram.

IMPRESSION: Spinal cord compression cannot be excluded based on
a non- contrast CT with this amount of artifact. Multilevel
degenerative changes and osteophytes causing at least moderate
spinal canal narrowing at C5-6.
.
[**7-21**] Myelogram: IMPRESSION: Successful fluorographically guided
myelogram via the lumbar puncture at L3. No evidence of
significant central canal stenosis. For further detailed
findings, please refer to the CT myelogram of the same day.




Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 y/o female with HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, OSA,
Asthma
with slurred speech and LE weakness
.
#) Slurred speech, LE weakness. Still unclear etiology. Per
patient, this was resolving by the date of discharge.  Had
negative CT scan of head. CT of spine showed spinal canal
narrowing at cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels. CT after
myelograms shows severe stenosis at the thoracic level. Patient
refused the possiblity of neurosurgery.
.
#) CAD: CE neg X 2. No additional chest pain complaints once
transferred to the floor.
- Continued ASA, plavix, metoprolol, atorvastatin, added back
ACEI on last day (had been held secondary to ARF)
.
#) Bradycardia with escape rhythm: Resolved. Thought to be due
to BB overdose in the setting of renal failure. Now in sinus.
- monitored on Telemetry without events
- continued on low dose beta blocker
.
#) Wheezing: still unclear whether pulm edema or asthma or an
element of both. LVEF >55%.
- continued alb and ip nebs
.
#) OSA: continued on BiPAP.
.
#) ARF: Likley pre renal secondary to lasix as improved with
hydration. Renal u/s negative for hydronephrosis
- Cr 1.0 at discharge
- discharged on [**12-20**] dose of Lasix that she was taking on
admission: 40 mg po qd
.
#) DM: Continued on glyburide. Insulin sliding scale. Blood
sugars well-controlled on floor.
.
#) Microcytic Anemia: needs outpatient colonoscopy
.
#) FEN: Diabetic/Caradiac Diet
.
#) PPX: Heparin SC
