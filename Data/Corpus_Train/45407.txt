s/p fasciotomy followed by closure of right arm for compartment
syndrome


History of Present Illness:
69M with hx of seizure disorder and med noncompliance who was
admitted to [**Hospital1 4**] on [**9-23**] after being found down in his home. Pt
states he felt dizzy which is typical for how he feel before a
seizure and he has no memory after that. Per patient he was
found about 12 hours later on his basement floor by his sister.
At the time he was unable to move his RUE and had multiple
abrasions and therefore was sent to the ED.
.
In the ED his vitals were T 99.7, HR 95, BP 136/91, 93 % on RA,
98 % on 2 L, CK was found to be [**Numeric Identifier 23846**], lactate 3.9, cr 2.2, CT
head and CXR negative and plain films of right arm with no
fracture. He received 3 NS, I L D5W with 3 amps of HCO3, ASA 325
mg, gabitril 4 mg x1, lamictal 300 mg x1, paxil, zonegran 300 mg
x1 (his home meds). He was evaluated by orthopedic surgery and
was found to have a compartment syndrome (loss of radial pulse)
and was taken to the OR for compartment release.
.
In the MICU, he was given ~4L of bicarb in D5W to keep UOP>200
cc per hour. He was then transitioned to normal saline. His
creatinine and CPK trended down with fluid resuscitation.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt reported mild pain and tingling in
his right arm. Otherwise, feeling well, good appetite, no
headache.

.
Right arm x-ray: No fracture or dislocation of the right
shoulder, right elbow, or right hand.
.
CXR:  Linear opacities of the right middle lobe are more likely
atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical context, pneumonia is a
possibility.
.
Head CT: No intracranial hemorrhage or other acute intracranial
pathology. No significant change from [**2665-1-11**].


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 69M with hx of mental retardation, seizure disorder,
medical noncompliance who was down for a prolonged time after a
seizure which led to rhabdo, acute renal failure and compartment
syndrome s/p release surgery
.
1. Rhabdomyolysis: Likely in setting of fall and being down for
several hours. s/p several liters of fluid in MICU with
resolution of CK (down from peak of 25,000) and creatinine.
.
2. Compartment syndrome: Developed in setting of being down on
arm for several hours. Ortho took patient to OR on admission for
fasciotomy of right arm given lose of radial pulse.  He was then
taken back to the OR five days later for closure.  On discharge,
pt had decreased sensation of his right hand along with 2/5 hand
grip strength.  Ortho evaluated the patient and stated that he
was OK for discharge.  he will follow-up with ortho in 2 weeks
for suture removal.  He should been non-weight bearing to the
right arm with dressing changes daily.
.
3. ARF: Likely due to rhabdo. Creatinine peaked at 2.4 and
improved to 1.4-1.5 with fluids.  His baseline appears to be
1.2-1.5.
.
4. fall/seizure disorder: Pt has a hx of seizure disorder.  Due
to his history of mental retardation, the patient's neighbor had
been helping him take his medications on time on the weekend and
on the weekdays, the patient was supervised at his workplace.
However, the neighbor recently moved away, thus the patient no
longer had the supervision.  He has seizure episodes in the past
for similar reasons.  Arrhythmia was ruled out with monitoring
on telemetry and cardiac enzymes were negative x 2.  His
outpatient neurologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and she recommended
continuing his outpatient regimen.  He was maintained on
lamictal, zonisamide and topamax.  Per the neurologist, the
zonisamide capsules were to be opened and the contents sprinkled
into one teaspoonful of soft solid, since the patient was unable
to swallow the pill.
.
# Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped from 52.9 --> 42.5
--> 35.8.  This was attributed to hemodilution since the patient
received a large amount of IV hydration.  He had no signs of
acute blood loss and he remained hemodynamically stable.
.
# Leukocytosis: The white blood cell count was elevated on
initial presentation and was attributed to stress reaction.  No
other source of infection was found and the white count
elevation resolved afterward.
.
# Anxiety/depression: Patient was maintained on his outpatient
regimen of paroxetine.
