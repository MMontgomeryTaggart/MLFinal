HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69 year old male
patient who was admitted to [**Hospital1 186**] through the Emergency Department on [**2832-11-13**],
with increasing shortness of breath.  The patient had a
previous hospitalization from [**10-31**] through [**11-4**], for which he was scheduled for an attempted apical
conization, however, he was found to have significant aortic
insufficiency and the procedure was aborted.  The patient was
discharged home on [**2832-11-4**], without diuretic and he
was scheduled to undergo aortic valve replacement on [**11-15**], with Dr. [**Name (STitle) 3820**].

On admission to the hospital, the patient was noted to have a
chest x-ray which was significant for a right pleural
effusion as well as congestive heart failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
    bypass graft times five in [**2823**].
2.  Status post myocardial infarction in [**2812**].
3.  Aortic stenosis with aortic insufficiency with a
    calculated aortic valve area of 0.8 to 0.9.
4.  Asthma.
5.  ETOH abuse; the patient states his last drink was on
    [**2832-11-13**].
6.  The patient admits to smoking one pack per day, however,
    has a significantly higher smoking history in the past up
    to three to four pack per day per patient's family.
7.  The patient has also had a history of multiple falls with
    rib, ankle, and forearm fractures in the past; question
    if this is related to his alcohol intake.
8.  He is status post radical prostatectomy in [**2828**].
9.  He is status post rectal polypectomy.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Zoloft 50 mg q. day.
3.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg twice a day.
4.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states an intolerance to sedation as
this causes increased confusion and agitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission:  The patient
was afebrile.  His pulse was 56 in normal sinus rhythm.  His
blood pressure was 107/50; respiratory rate 17 and room air
oxygen saturation was 88%.  On physical examination, HEENT
unremarkable.  Neck without jugular venous distention.  Chest
with crackles one-third of the way up on the right.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with a
Grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is obese,
positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.  His
extremities were without edema and he had two plus palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses and his extremities were warm.
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII are intact and
he is alert and oriented at the time of admission.  Strength
was [**4-3**].

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  Revealed a
white blood cell count of 7,700, hematocrit 34.6, platelet
count 195,000, sodium 138, BUN of 26, creatinine of 1.6 and
blood glucose of 85.

His EKG on admission to the hospital was normal sinus rhythm
with a left anterior fascicular block and a right bundle
branch block as well as left ventricular hypertrophy.

On the [**11-14**], the patient received a dental
consult and he was cleared by the dental service to undergo
an aortic valve replacement.  On [**11-15**], the patient
went to the Operating Room where he underwent an aortic
endarterectomy as well as an aortic valve replacement with a
#23 mm [**Location (un) **] valve.

Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the
Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on
intravenous Milrinone.  His postoperative transesophageal
echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40%
which was an improvement in his preoperative ventricular
function.  The patient was on Profadol, however, had
increasing agitation and was placed on Dexmedetomidine for
sedation at that time.  He was weaned from the mechanical
ventilator and extubated in the evening on postoperative day
one.  The patient had a cardiac index of greater than 3 on
Levophed and Milrinone drip.  The Milrinone was discontinued
on the evening of postoperative day one.  The patient,
initially, on extubation was quite confused, however, not
agitated at that time.  The patient was started on
nitroprusside due to hypotension and oral Captopril was
added.  The patient continued to have a fair amount of chest
tube drainage from his pleural tube of serosanguinous fluid
so that was left in for another couple of days.

The patient, on postoperative day two, required Haldol and
Ativan due to increase in confusion and agitation.  He
required soft restraints for patient's safety.  The patient
wound up being over sedated due to his severe agitation,
requiring re-intubation because of respiratory compromised
that had occurred on [**11-20**] which was postoperative day
five.

A Neurology medical consultation was obtained at that time
and their conclusion was that this may be related to alcohol
withdrawal.  The patient had a CT scan of his head which was
negative.  Their thought was that the alcohol withdrawal
could be contributing.  Also, he could also have decreased
clearance of all the sedating medicines which he received for
previous agitation due to renal and hepatic dysfunction.  On
the [**11-19**], the patient experienced rapid atrial
fibrillation which was treated with Lopressor.  The patient
was not given Amiodarone at that time because there is a
history of slow heart rate as well as questionable liver
function due to his alcohol history.  The patient was
converted to normal sinus rhythm however, has had
intermittent pauses without appropriate capture with his
pacemaker via his epicardial wires.

The patient was started on postoperative day five on tube
feedings, the day he was reintubated.  He continued to have
copious endotracheal tube secretions with his reintubation.
His sputum was sent for culture which was found to have
Enterobacter and he was started on Levofloxacin at that time.
The patient extubated himself later that evening, remained
confused and extremely agitated and was restarted on Haldol
and Ativan.  The patient required aggressive pulmonary toilet
and continued to have respiratory acidosis, however, was
unable to stay extubated.  On the [**11-22**], the
patient was reintubated due to significant hypercarbia and
respiratory distress and respiratory acidosis.  He had
required a fair amount of sedation a couple of days leading
up to that due to his profound agitation questionably related
to alcohol withdrawal.  At the time of the reintubation, he
was found to have thick tan secretions, although his repeat
cultures were negative.  Pulmonary toilet was continued and
aggressive diuresis was continued and tube feeds were
resumed.

The patient was extubated again on [**11-25**].  At that
time, his mental status had improved; felt to be questionable
resolving encephalopathy.  He had some intermittent confusion
but much less agitation.  He was receiving some Haldol.  The
patient was continued on tube feeds via nasogastric tube.  On
[**11-26**], the patient underwent a swallowing evaluation
by the Speech Therapy Department as he did not pass his bed
side evaluation.  It was recommended that he go for a video
swallow which showed he was at risk for aspiration.  Tube
feeds were continued at that time.  The patient progressed
throughout the day with increasing agitation, attempting to
discontinue the intravenous line, arterial catheter as well
as the nasogastric tube and a one-to-one sitter was obtained
at that time.

Due to the patient's tenuous respiratory status, he was kept
in the Intensive Care Unit where aggressive pulmonary toilet
was continued.  On the [**11-28**], the patient's mental
status had significantly improved.  On [**11-29**], the
patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit to the
Telemetry Floor.  He was noted to have questionable
arrhythmia of either non-sustained ventricular tachycardia
versus wide complex supraventricular tachycardia, however, he
continued to have multiple episodes of this.

The patient's epicardial pacing wires were discontinued on
[**2832-12-1**].  The patient's primary Cardiology Group was
consulted about his arrhythmia issues.  He was seen here by
our Electrophysiology Service and it was decided upon that
the patient would be transferred to [**Hospital6 3816**]
under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1280**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1061**] who planned
to take him for EP Study at [**Hospital6 3816**] and
questionable AICD placement, if indicated.

On [**12-2**], the patient was reassessed by the Speech
therapist and it was their recommendation at that time that
he was stable.  His swallowing had improved significantly and
that he could continue with supervised feedings only and it
was their recommendation to continue tube feeds until he was
able to take an adequate oral intake.

The patient's most recent laboratory values are from [**2832-11-30**], which revealed a white blood cell count of 10,900,
hematocrit of 31.7 and a platelet count of 391,000.  Sodium
146, potassium 4.8.  The repeat of his potassium the
following day was 4.7.  Chloride 106, CO2 34, BUN 31 and
creatinine 0.7.  Blood glucose of 109.  PT 12.3, PTT 31.2.

His condition today, [**2832-12-3**], the date of discharge
is as follows:  The patient is without complaint.  The
patient's tube feeds have been on hold, however, he does
continue with a nasogastric tube in place.  Temperature is
97.9 F.; pulse 50; normal sinus rhythm.  Blood pressure
106/96.  Oxygen saturation is 98% on four liters of nasal
cannula.  His 24-hour intakes and outputs were 860 and 675
out as of midnight last night.  Coronary examination is
regular rate and rhythm.  The sternum is stable without
drainage.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.

The patient's condition is stable.
