   Assessment and Plan
   63F with CHF, COPD; admitted with 1 week of increased dyspnea, wheeze.
   Suspect COPD exacerbation in setting of increased wheeze; no evidence
   of PNA.  Always a possibility that increased left atrial pressure
   secondary to CHF can contribute, though no clear evidence of overt
   pulmonary edema on exam or CXR.
   1.       COPD:
   - bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, spiriva
   - await flu swab, cultures
   - Prednisone 40mg
   - Will notify Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1592**] of her admission
   - d/c ceftriaxone; continue azithromycin
   2.       CHF:  Given lasix IV this morning (home dose) for perhaps mild
   pulmonary edema
   -   Home lasix now, but would aim for TBB negative 500ml today.
   -   Home BP regimen
