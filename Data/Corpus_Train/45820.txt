Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4496**]
Chief Complaint:
sob, hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiV pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
72-year-old woman with recent onset atrial fibrillation on
coumadin (s/p unsuccessful cardioversion), hypertension/LVH,
type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 6 on [**8-12**]), moderate aortic stenosis,
left bundle-branch block, prior tobacco use, diastolic and
systolic CHF s/p multiple admissions, hypothyroidism, and prior
traumatic brain injury ([**3388**])p/w worsening LE edema, increasing
DOE, and found to have new hyponatremia to 109 from 125 on
[**3413-3-26**].

Of note, she was recently discharged on [**3413-2-28**] with CHF
exacerbation/new afib/renal failure. TTE that admission showed
dilated LV with depressed EF and moderate-severe mitral
regurgitation, and PAP were mildly elevated (32-34 mmHg). This
was presumed due to her tachyarrythmia. The severity of aortic
stenosis could not adequately be assessed. She had a
cardioversion and was discharged in NSR, but appears to have
gone back into afib shortly thereafter. She is on amiodarone,
digoxin, and coumadin.
.
Her dry weight is 138 pounds, and patient reports gaining 12
pounds over the past two weeks. On [**3413-3-18**], she had been told to
hold her home lasix (20mg PO BID) because her weight was
decreasing and she was felt to be clinically dry with low BP's.
Then, because she was having increasing weight/edema/DOE, she
called her cardiologist who advised her to restart lasix 20mg
and hold home lisinopril. Patient was still complaining of sx
and advised to increase lasix to 40mg daily. She was also c/o
nausea, told OK to hold digoxin and coumadin, but to come in on
Monday AM for lab testing. Found to have sodium of 109 and
referred to ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 96.3, P 101, BP 115/78, R 20,
95% on RA and then 99% on 2L NC. Patient had two sets of labs to
confirm her new hyponatremia to 109. She also had a CXR that
showed mild CHF. No medications were given in the ED. Cardiology
and nephrology were consulted. Her hematocrit was noted to be
slightly lower, but guaiac was negative. Her INR is 3.9.
.
Upon speaking with the patient and her son, 5 days ago patient
had onset of fatigue, weakness, DOE, low UOP, which has been
progressing to the point where she only has the energy to sit up
and eat. She denies CP, denies angina. She does endorse
intermittent nausea, +vomiting on Saturday. Constipated x 2
days, but passing flatus, no abdominal pain. No blood in stool,
no black stools. Son also notes she has been increasingly
confused, with memory difficulty. She denies any new neurologic
deficits.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

Imaging:
CXR:
FINDINGS: The heart size is enlarged. Mild prominence of the
central
pulmonary vasculature is noted as well as small bilateral
pleural effusions, consistent with mild CHF. Unchanged left
retrocardiac atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Unchanged
orthopedic intramedullary nail in the right
humerus.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with mild CHF.

Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20 %) with inferior akinesis, septal dyskinesis and
apical akinesis/dyskinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere (lateral
base moves best). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened.

There is an echogenic structure associated with the right cusp
(see clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) that is likely due to cusp thickening/deformation
or prominent Lambl's excrescence (generally an incidental
finding); cannot definitively exclude vegetation. This echogenic
structure was not seen in the prior study but the aortic valve
was not as well visualized in the prior study.

There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3413-2-27**],
left ventricular systolic function appears more depressed. The
septum is now dyskinetic. Right ventricular systolic function
appears slightly more depressed. Echogenic structure asosciated
with aortic valve as noted above.

MRI head & C-spine: No definite evidence for acute intracranial
pathology


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 5963**] is a 72-year-old woman with recent onset atrial
fibrillation on coumadin (s/p unsuccessful cardioversion),
hypertension/LVH, type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 6 on [**8-12**]), moderate
aortic stenosis, left bundle-branch block, prior tobacco use,
diastolic and systolic CHF s/p multiple admissions,
hypothyroidism, and prior traumatic brain injury ([**3388**])p/w CHF
exacerbation and severe hyponatremia.

1. Hyponatremia: Patient with drop in sodium from 125-->109 in
less than two weeks (though likely in last week based on
history). Likely hypervolemic in nature, given history and exam.
Sodium trended up to 129 with IV lasix, no acute mental status
changes. Na 132-135 aat discharge, free water restriction in
place.

2. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic CHF: Last EF 30%, now
depressed to 20%. Thought to be secondary to tachyarrythmia. In
the past, atrial fibrillation has contributed significantly to
her exacerbations, so she was evaluated by EP for ablation. This
was done (see below) and rates now 65-70 paced. Could not
tolerate ACEi and beta-blocker given hypotension so these were
held at discharge. Weight 60.1 on day of discharge and
Furosemide 10 mg cont QOD. Lungs are clear and pt has diffuse
[**12-5**]+ peripheral edema. Please weigh daily and consider changing
Furosemide to 10 mg daily if weight increases.

3. Atrial Fibrillation/flutter: Rate in low 100's on admission.
Has had multiple unsuccessful cardioversions for afib in the
past. EP was consulted and AV Node ablation with BiV pacer was
done on [**3413-4-15**]. Her pacer site is near left shoulder and has no
ecchymosis or significant tenderness. She will be on Clindamycin
PO for total of 3 days to prevent infection at the site. A
device clinic appt was made for one week after procedure in
conjunction with an ECHO. She will see her outpt cardiologist at
the end of the month. Amiodarone and Digoxin was discontinued
after ablation. INR in mid 2's on 3 mg Warfarin daily. Would
check INR QOD while pt on Clindamycin.

4. Coronaries: No caths in past, not thought to have ischemic
cardiomyopathy as cause of heart failure. Troponins flat on
admission despite several days of symptoms, so likely not
causing her symptoms. Not currently on ASA. [**Month (only) 115**] consider baby
ASA due to [**Name (NI) 27337**].

5. Anemia: Found to be Fe deficient with drop from 28 to 22 in
few days. Stool OB negative and no other obvious signs of
bleeding. Thought that phlebotomy was a contributing factor but
should consider repeat colonoscpoy if this continues to be an
issue after discharge. Ferrous sulfate was started on [**4-15**].
Hemolysis labs were negative on [**3413-4-6**].

6. Diabetes: On metformin at home, last HgA1C 6%.  HISS inhouse.
 Given rising creatinine, Metformin was not started on d/c but
should be restarted when creatinine stable.

7. Hypothyroidism: Continued synthroid.

8. Dyslipidemia: Continued atorvastatin

10. Hypertension: Pt has been hypotensive for most of hospital
stay. Lisinopril was held but should be restarted if systolic BP
consistantly > 100.

Discharge Instructions:
You had an exacerbation of your congetive heart failure and your
low sodium level worsened. You were diuresed to take of the
fluid and it is thought that your high heart rate is
contributing to the congestive heart failure. We were unable to
slow your heart rate with medicines and you did not tolerate the
beta blocker. You had an AV node ablation and a biventricular
pacemaker was placed on [**4-15**]. You tolerated this without
complications. You became quite anemic during your hospital
stay, possibly becuase of frequent lab tests but possibly
because of some bleeding in your GI tract. You will need to have
your blood counts followed closely and should consider another
colonoscopy if you continue to be anemic. We have started you on
Iron tablets to help your body make more blood.
WE made the following changes to your medicines:
1. Discontinue the amiodarone and digoxin
2. Discontinue the Lisinopril because your blood pressures are
low
3. Started Clindamycin for 3 days total to prevent an infection
at the pacer site.
4. Start Metamucil wafer and Colace to prevent constipation
5. Start Ferrous sulfate (Iron) to help your body make blood.
6. Decrease the Lasix to 10 mg every other day
7. Stop Metformin for now with creatinine rising.
8. Start Trazadone to help you sleep at night.
