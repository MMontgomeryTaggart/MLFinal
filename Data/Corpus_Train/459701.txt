   Imaging: ECHO [**2599-10-26**]
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mitral
   regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is no
   pericardial effusion

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary TB transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning. At the time of transfer he is fairly comfortable on
   2L nasal cannula.
   .
   1. Hypoxia: The patient is currently hypoxic with some dyspnea.  His
   multiple etiologies include fluid overload from renal failure,
   pulmonary mycobacterial infection and hemoptysis status post bronch.
   He is doing well on 2L nasal cannula at this time.  Concern for
   underlying tamponade physiology not likely given stat Echo today
   revealing a resolved pericardial effusion.
   - Plan for each underlying problem as below
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - ABG today
   - F/U Final CXR read
   .
   2. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. New EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia versus
   rate related change.  No acute failure on Echo.
   - Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure tolerance.
   .
   3. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  Given his fluid overload causing hypoxia, the
   plan is for HD/CVVH today.
   - Correct coagulopathy
   - Obtain HD line access
   - Begin CVVH to remove large volumes.
   - Renal recs
   .
   4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 4.0, likely from recent warfarin
   and multiple antibiotic administration given new diagnosis of TB. No
   reason to suspect worsening liver function at this time, although
   multiple meds may cause this in the future.
   - FFP to correct to 1.5 for procedures (such as lines abovE)
   - Vit K 2mg
   .
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   .
   6. Pulmonary TB: The patient has evidence of Pulmonary Mycobacterial
   infection, presumed to be TB until proven otherwise.  Cultures
   outstanding.
   - F/u further TB testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - respiratory isolation
   .
   7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and a supratherpeutic INR giving him multiple reasons to
   have hemoptysis.
   - Continue to monitor, correct coagulopathy.
   .
   8. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   .
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, NPO until line placed, then renal diet
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots while supratherapeutic
   Access: Peripheral, better access pending
   Code:  Full (confirmed with patient)

   Disposition: MICU pending CVVH/HD
