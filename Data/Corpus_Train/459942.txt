   Assessment and Plan
   30 YOM with no pmh p/w CP in the setting of cocaine and etoh use, s/p
   cardiac arrest and resus.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  LAD thrombus was noted on cath, likely [**3-8**] cocaine
   induced vessel spasms.  resolved after cath and intervention, no stents
   were placed. given no risk factors in the family or his pmh, plaque
   rupture is a less likely alternative.
   - cont. ASA, integrillin gtt
   - on statin high dose and check lipids and hgA1C in am
   - no BB, given cocaine use.
   .
   # PUMP:  unknown baseline LV function.  Patient was euvolemic on
   admission exam. cardiac function [**Last Name (un) **] currently will need to reassess
   with echo and records.
   - trend CE
   - holding off BB, give ca channel blockers in am.
   - consider ACEI if EF < 40%
   - echo in am
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in sinus, prior arrythmia is likely [**3-8**] cocaine
   induced vessel spasm vs thrombus induced ischemia vs electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - on tele, continue to monitor
   - recieved phentolamine.
   - mg, k and ca repletion prn
   .
   # alcohol/substance use: unsure of the severity of his use, will take
   precaution on treating/monitoring for withdraw
   - on ciwa scale, monitor mental status
   - s/w consult on substance abuse.
   .
   FEN:  replete lytes, K>4, mg > 2
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt.
   -Pain management with morphine.
   -Bowel regimen with senna, docusate.
