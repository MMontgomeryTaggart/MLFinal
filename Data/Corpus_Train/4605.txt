Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 19304**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On [**8-10**] he was brought
directly to the operating room where he underwent a ascending
aorta replacement. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition on a titrated propofol
drip. Later on op day he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. That evening he was off all
drips and then transferred to the floor on post-op day one. Beta
blockers and diuretics were initiated and he was gently diuresed
towards pre-op wt. Foley and chest tubes were removed on post-op
day two. Pacing wires removed on post-op day three and beta
blockade titrated for HR/BP management. Physical therapy
followed him throughout post-op course for strength and
mobility. He continued to improve quite rapidly without any
post-op complications. He was discharged to home with VNA
services and the appropriate follow-up appointments on post-op
day four.
