Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4496**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
74 yo woman with past medical history of CHF, coronary artery
disease s/p CABG in [**3137**] who presents to the hospital with
shortness of breath that started 3-4 days ago and acutely
worsened around 5 am this morning. She increased her home 02
from 2L to 10L, took a nitro and took 40 mg Lasix without
improvement.
.
Of note, the patient was recently hospitalized in CCU for CHF
exacerbation between [**3150-10-1**] and [**3150-10-5**]. During that admission,
she was diuresed with Lasix and sent home on PO Lasix.
Amlodipine was stopped, Quinapril was decreased in dose to 5 mg
daily and she was started on aspirin. She saw her cardiologist,
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6563**], after admission who started Carvedilol (dose
unknown.) Three days ago when she started to feel short of
breath, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6563**] increased her Lasix from 20 mg daily to 40 mg
daily.
.
At baseline, the patient is quite limited by exertional dyspnea
and shortness of breath at baseline. She has 23 steps at home,
and is able to get up those stairs but only very slowly. Her
exertional dyspnea is predictable and rapidly resolves with
cessation of activities. She also had a recent admission to [**Hospital 4831**] for a CHF exacerbation in [**Month (only) 539**], at which time
she also had a cardiac catherization which per the patient
showed patency in 3 of her 4 bypass grafts. After that
admission, she was weaned off of her lasix by [**Month (only) 484**] due to drops
in blood pressure- as noted above, this was restarted on last
admission. She had a stress test in [**Month (only) 439**] which showed possible
perfusion abnormalities.
.
On review of systems, she denies recent fever. She also has a
history of DVTs x2 and had previously been on coumadin, but has
been off of coumadin for at least 2 years. She has 3 pillow
orthopnea. She denies fevers, chills or rigors. No change in
bowel habits. No symptoms of claudication. No recent weight gain
or change in eating habits.
.
On arrival to the ED, her BP was 200/100 with O2 saturations 95%
on NRB and 100% on bipap breathing in 40s with rales bilaterally
half way up the lungs on exam. In the ED, the patient was given
80 mg IV Lasix and a Nitro drip was started. Pressure dropped to
101/64 and O2 sats improved to 93% on 5L NC with RR 25.

Mother - diabetes

Physical Exam:
Admission Exam:
GENERAL: Well appearing woman in NAD. Oriented x3. Mood, affect
appropriate.  Speaking in full sentences.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: Supple with JVP of 6 cm.
CARDIAC: Slightly muffled S1.  3/6 systolic murmur radiating to
apex, possible [**1-11**] diastolic murmur.  Normal S2. No S3/S4
LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: Mild bilateral edema L>R.  Vein harvest scar on
left
leg. Warm and well perfused.
PULSES:  1+ radial pulses bilaterally.  DP and PT Pulses not
palpable.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the mid-septum. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 55 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-7**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic
dysfunction suggestive of CAD. Mild-moderate aortic
regurgitation.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has severe aortic stenosis. Based on [**3146**] ACC/AHA
Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is a surgical
candidate, surgical intervention has been shown to improve
survival.

CT chest:
IMPRESSIONS:

1. Longstanding sternal nonunion following prior sternotomy,
with
fragmentation of multiple sternal closure wires, and
well-corticated bony

2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving both the native
and graft
coronary vessels.

3. Prior CABG with graft vessels arising from the anterior
aspect of the
ascending aorta. No atherosclerotic calcification involving the
ascending
aorta.

4. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.

5. Small hiatal hernia.

6. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.

Carotid US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous plaque at the ostium of the right internal
carotid artery as
well as slightly more significantly in the proximal left
internal and external
carotid arteries.
2. No significant stenosis noted on the right side.
3. Suspected 60-69% stenosis involving the proximal left
internal carotid
artery.
4. Prograde flow in both vertebral arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y.o woman with history of CABG and CHF, also DVT who presents
with acute onset of dyspnea and evidence of pulmonary edema,
consistent with a severe exacerbation of congestive heart
failure.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic Congestive Heart Failure
exacerbation: CHF exacerbation was attributed to severe Aortic
Stenosis seen on echo. Pt was initially diuresed with lasix and
had improved symptoms. Carvedilol and quinapril were initially
held and then restarted. Furosemide was continued at previous
dose of 40 mg daily. Weight at discharge was 184 pounds and pt
appeared euvolemic.
.
# Severe Aortic stenosis: Pt found to have severe Aortic
Stenosis with aortic valve area: 0.8-1.0cm2. Echo also revealed
mod-severe MR. CT surgery was consulted and reccomended surgery.
Pre-op workup was initiated. Pt had CT chest (revealing small
bilateral pleural effusions and extensive atherosclerosis).
Carotid US performed which showed 89% stenosis on left side and
no sig stenosis on right side. PFTs returned showing mixed
restrictive and obstructive disease. Cardiac surgeon Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 223**]
[**Name (STitle) 222**] will schedule surgery.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease: R/O'd. No significant chest pain
during hospital stay. Continued ASA 81 mg, Atorvastatin 40 mg
daily. Given her marginal BP, Imdur was not given during
hospital stay and not restarted at discharge. The RCA may be
bypassed during the AVR surgery. If so, vein mapping will be
needed and will be arranged by the cardiac surgeon.
.
# Hypertension: Restarted carvedilol and quinapril. Held Imdur.
SBP 98-103 on day of discharge.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Sugars in the 170-350 range. Family
requested [**Last Name (un) 93**] consult. She was started on 75/25 humalog here
in the hospital with daily [**Last Name (un) 93**] oversight. She will go home on
a new regimen of 70/30 Novalog (humalog with NPH) of 36 units in
the morning and 24 units at night. She will also do fingersticks
before each meal and has a new Humalog sliding scale. Metformin
was held but restarted at discharge. She will f.u with [**Last Name (un) 93**]
outpatient.
.
# GERD: Continued Esomeprazole
.
# Dispo: She will go home and return for surgery. She has an
appt in 4 days with her cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6563**].

Pt refuses VNA despite encouraging.
Pt noted to have enlarged flat tongue with MCV in low 80s. Might
have B12 def. Pts B12 levels should be checked and followed
outpatient.
