64-year-old M with h/o single-vessel CABG in [**2929**], hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, as well as PAF who presented with 3
days of fatigue and shortness of breath along with recent onset
of fevers.  He was not feeling well in general over several
days, but got acutely ill at a barbeque with his family.  He was
sitting in a chair at the event and he felt so weak that he
could not stand.  He needed multiple family members to help him
up out of the chair and noted that he felt extremely hot at this
time.  He has had chills at home on a relatively regular basis
since the late [**2924**].  He endorsed fever to 101 over the weekend
as well as nausea and decreased PO intake with one day of
diarrhea.

Physical Exam:
VS: T=97.0 BP=116/71 HR=84 RR= 20 O2 sat= 99% 3L NC
GENERAL:  Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, slightly injected, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral
mucosa. No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with JVP not visible, No cervical LAD.
CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. No M/R/G
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. Bibasilar inspiratory
crackles
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: Bilateral 2+ pitting edema- currently wrapped.
Stasis ulcer on R shin and surrounding erythema.

PULSES:
Right: Carotid 2+  DP dopplerable PT dopplerable
Left: Carotid 2+  DP dopplerable PT dopplerable

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**8-19**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Tib/fib X-ray [**8-19**]:  No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.
.
CT torso [**8-20**]:
1. Airspace opacification at the right lung base with air
bronchogram, and
possible cavitation. Small right pleural effusion. Scattered
lymph nodes in mediastinum, with prominent lymph nodes in the
right hilum, could be reactive.
2. Enlarged kidneys with perinephric stranding.
3. Stable appearance of calcified splenic lesion.
4. Mass vs abscess, 4 x 4.3 cm size, in liver
.
RUQ U/S [**8-21**]:
1. Mixed echogenic lesion within the gallbladder fossa is
consistent with resolving hematoma as seen on prior CT scan from
one year ago.
2. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. Please note that
other more
severe forms of liver disease including significant hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
.
ECHO [**8-21**] (TEE)- No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No LA/LAA thromubs seen. No valvular vegetations
seen on the aortic, tricuspid or mitral valves. Moderate TR
seen.
.
RUQ U/S ([**8-21**])
1. Mixed echogenic lesion within the gallbladder fossa is
consistent with
resolving hematoma as seen on prior CT scan from one year ago.
2. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. Please note that
other more
severe forms of liver disease including significant hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis
cannot be excluded.
.
CXR [**8-21**]- There has been previous median sternotomy and coronary
bypass
surgery. New vascular congestion and left-sided interstitial
opacities
suggest worsening volume status of the patient. There remains
marked
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, present dating back to
[**2942-3-22**]
chest radiograph, with adjacent atelectasis involving right
middle and right lower lobes. There is also a small right
pleural effusion.
.
CXR [**8-22**]: There is newly developed left lung consolidation that
given its rapid development is highly concerning for massive
aspiration. Rapidly progressing infection is unlikely. There is
no evidence of pulmonary edema. There is still high position of
right hemidiaphragm and stable appearance of cardiomediastinal
silhouette.
.
CXR ([**8-23**])- Slight interval improvement in the extensive left mid
and lower
lung consolidation, presumably related to massive aspiration,
stable large
right pleural effusion with new left lower lobe collapse.
.
CXR ([**8-25**])- There has been some clearing of the left opacities
since the two prior chest x-rays. Atelectasis of the right base
persists.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo M with single-vessel CABG in [**2929**], HTN, HLD, DM, PAF,
presented with fatigue, fever of unknown origin, found to be in
Afib with RVR, s/p cardioversion to NSR, s/p treatment for CAP
and aspiration pneumonia.
.
# Afib with RVR: initially presented with atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response (HR 160s). TEE showed no
vegetations or atrial clots, and cardioversion performed [**8-21**].
Initially went back into Afib and started on rate control with
diltiazem 60mg QID as well as metoprolol.  Patient converted
into NSR again [**2943-8-28**]. Diltiazem was discontinued and
metoprolol was continued. Patient remained hemodynamically
stable. Suspect that patient will remain in NSR as amiodarone
stores build up.  Plan is for patient to continue 400 mg
amiodarone until [**9-6**], then he will switch to 200 mg daily
indefinitely.  He is to continue is home dose metoprolol on
discharge.  He will remain off diltiazem.
.
#Fever/atypical lymphocytes/lymphocytic predominance on diff:
Likely due to CAP (RLL air bronchograms) and aspiration
pneumonia (on later CXR findings, LLL infiltrate, s/p
extubation).  Patient completed 9 day course of vancomycin, 10
day course of zosyn, and 6 day course of ciprofloxacin (with
prior levofloxacin), as per ID recs.  With regard to potential
source of fevers: Pulmonary was consulted and bronch/right
thoracentesis was deferred, as his clinical picture was
improving and the fact that his R pleural effusion was
chronic/stable.  Liver US showed ?abscess vs. resolving
hematoma, but after discussion with radiology and ID, the
findings were felt to be more c/w resolving hematoma, and US
guided needle aspiration was not performed.  On chest CT, some
question of cavitary lesion/RLL air bronchograms, which was
followed by TB rule out with three negative sputum samples.
LFTs were wnl, influenza DFA negative, blood cx were negative,
urine cx negative, C. diff negative, urinary Legionella
negative, RPR negative, CMV IgG/IgM negative, TB sputum x 3 was
negative, tib/fib negative for osteomyelitis, TEE negative for
vegetations.  Patient was afebrile for 72+ hours on discharge.
Of note, patient had EBV VCA-IgM Ab positivity, which may
suggest recent infection. Discussed positive EBV with ID, who
mentioned that it was likely cross-reactivity with other tests,
and that his viral syndrome/course will likely be self-limited.
HIV was discussed with patient (and risk factors were
discussed), but testing was deferred at this time, as per
patient request.
.
# CORONARIES: Troponin leak (peak 0.19) likely [**2-18**] ARF as well
as demand given RVR to 160s. Baseline trop about 0.10 and pt.
denies chest pain.  As such clinical suspicion for ACS was low.
Patient was continued on his metoprolol.  His lisinopril was,
and will be, held given ARF on CKD.  His simvastatin was
decreased to 10 mg given his unusual lipid panel (LDL 5, HDL 9)
which is similar to [**2942**] studies.
.
# PUMP: CXR with initial signs c/w volume overload and was
initially diuresed with IV lasix for pulmonary edema.  TEE on
[**2943-8-21**] showed preserved EF with normal valvular function, no
vegetations.
.
# Oxygen requirement: possibly secondary to post-pneumonia
reactive airways vs. (more likely) deconditioning.  He has
worked with physical therapy as an inpatient and will be
discharged to home with PT services and home oxygen.  Of note,
patient will likely need PFTs on discharge, and this can be
addressed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PCP).
.
# Anemia: H/H 6.9/22.1 on discharge and it is apparent that
patient has some component of anemia of chronic disease from his
CKD. Renal was consulted and patient is to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for possible Procrit injections and IV iron therapy. Stool
guiacs were negative. No signs/symptoms of bleeding.
.
# Diabetes: Poorly controlled, last A1c 10.5% with complications
of nephropathy and neuropathy.  Patient's home glargine was
increased to 54U QAM, and he will be discharged on this regimen,
given his insulin requirements.  He is to follow-up with his
outpatient endocrinologist and has voiced understanding.
.
# Hyponatremia: renal feels this may be related to initial
hyervolemic hyponatremia (given volume overload), and now
possible hyponatremic hyponatremia.  PO intake was encouraged
near time of discharge, Na was uptrending, and on discharge Na
was 131.  Patient is to follow-up Na levels with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(in PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 28733**]) as well as with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (nephrology).
.
# ARF on CKD: Baseline Cr~2. Cr jumped to 4.4 on admission and
was 3.4 on discharge.  Renal was consulted and they felt this
was most c/w ATN due to relative hypoperfusion during his afib
with rvr as well as possible AIN given his cipro/vanco Abx
regimen.  Patient will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in nephrology clinic.
.
# Anticoagulation: patient is on anticoagulation for PAF, was
bridged with heparin while INR was subtherapeutic.  His coumadin
requirements were decreased to 3 mg, as his amiodarone stores
built up.  INR goal [**2-19**] and on discharge, INR 1.9 on discharge.
Patient will be discharged on 3 mg coumadin, with close f/u with
coumadin clinic.
.
# Lower extremity edema/ulcers: stable without signs of
osteomyelitis on exam or imaging. Wound care was consulted, legs
were kept elevated, and wound care recs continued while
admitted.
.
# Dispo - patient will be discharged home with VNA services, PT
services, and home oxygen.  He is to call for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 368**] with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (nephrology) as he may
be candidate for Procrit.  He has ID f/u on [**2943-10-7**].

Discharge Instructions:
You had a pneumonia that was treated with antibiotics. Your
atrial fibrillation was very fast which required a cardioversion
and treatment with amiodarone, a medicine that slows your heart
rate and hopfully will keep you in normal sinus rhythm. You
still will need to take your couamdin and follow-up with the
coumadin clinic here at [**Hospital1 4**] to keep your INR between 2.0 and
3.0.

5. Decrease your coumadin to 3mg daily. Your last INR was 1.9 on
discharge and you will need less coumadin now that you are on
amiodarone. The coumadin clinic will resume responsibility for
your coumadin dosing after you leave the hospital.
