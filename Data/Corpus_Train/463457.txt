   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 53 yo M with hypertension and h/o positive PPD
   presents with acute onset of SSCP found to have STEMI significant for
   RV infarct.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient presented with acute STEMI in RCA territory,
   complicated by CHB in cath lab and Afib post cath. His risk includes
   HTN. He received 2 overlapping BMS in cath lab and was started on
   integrillin.
   -[**Last Name (LF) 11393**], [**First Name3 (LF) 5**] 325mg, plavix 75 to start in am
   -metoprolol for rate control especially given Afib
 25mg PO q6h,
   uptitrate as tolerated
   -atorvastatin 80mg daily
   -f/u lipid panel, HA1C
   -lisinopril 5mg daily to start in am
   -trend CKs to peak
   -EKG in am
   .
   # PUMP: Currently patient appear euvolemic, does have small Q in
   inferior leads. Echo would be beneficial to see RV function.
   - f/u TTE
   - I/O net negative.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient had intermittent CHB in setting of infarct, currently
   in Afib with RVR to 120s after revascularization. Will likely convert
   on his own.
   - monitor on tele
   - Metoprolol PO q6h, holding off acei
   - IV heparin today.
   - patient has been in AFIB for 24hours will need
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely [**1-21**] infarct, no signs or symptoms of infection.
   -CXR for baseline
   -trend
   .
   # Elevated INR: Likely [**1-21**] to anticoagulation currently vs nutritional.
   -trend coags
   -consider PO VitK in am
   .
   # Hypertension: per patient report although does not know medication
   and neither does his wife.
   -monitor
   -BB and ACEI as above
   .
   FEN: NPO for now
   .
   ACCESS: 2 PIV's
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots, patient refusing SC heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with prn senna/colace
   -stress ulcer ppx not indicated
