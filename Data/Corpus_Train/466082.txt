   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old male with past medical history significant for known CAD
   but no MI who presents with anterior STEMI.
   1) STEMI/CAD: The patient had a large anterior STEMI but was
   revascularized with placement of a DES in the proximal LAD.  Since
   catheterization, the patient has been hemodynamically stable and chest
   pain free. CE
s elevated this AM, have not yet peaked.
   -Continue Epifibatide gtt for 18 hours (1pm on [**1-8**])
   -Continue Heparin gtt for 48 hours (5pm on [**1-9**])
   -Continue Aspirin, high dose atorvastatin, holding beta blocker for
   relative bradycardia
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes to monitor resolution of ischemia
   -Echocardiogram to assess for wall motion abnormalities
   -Restart home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   -Lipid panel in AM, acknowledging that it may be altered by stress
   reaction to MI
   -Repeat EKG in AM to evaluate for any signs of recurrent ischemia
   2) PUMP: Despite large anterior wall STEMI the patient has no
   signs/symptoms of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at this time.
   No hypotension or signs of cardiogenic shock.
   -Holding off on starting beta blocker given relative bradycardia
   -Echocardiogram to assess for wall motion abnormalities
   -Will start home Ramipril 2.5mg daily over next 2-3 days or at
   discharge
   3) RHYTHM: Patient had 4-5 beats of NSVT at OSH in context of STEMI but
   in NSR since then.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -beta blocker when tolerated
   -Replete electrolytes PRN, K>4, Mg>2
   -If sustained VT would start Lidocaine gtt for post MI arrythmia
   4) DYSAUTONOMIA/PARTIAL COMPLEX SEIZURES: Patient stable on home
   regimen of Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine.
   - Continue Phenobarbitol and Lamotrigine at home dose
   5) BPH: Continue home Doxasosin 1mg qHS.
   6) HYPERTENSION: Currently normotensive.
   - Begin patient
s home Ramipril 2.5mg daily at discharge
   - Begin low-dose beta-blocker when hr tolerates
   7) HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On Simvastatin at baseline, will use high dose
   atorvastatin in context of acute MI.
   -Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily
   -Lipid panel pending
   8) Likely metabolic acidosis: Resolved with repeat labs. Likely
   compensatory for respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation in
   context of chest pain and acute myocardial infarction.
