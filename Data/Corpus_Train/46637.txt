History of Present Illness:
H/P reviewed and verified. Please see original HPI for details.
In brief, Ms. [**Known patient lastname 4278**] is an 87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on
dofetalide and coumadin, sCHF (EF 40%), h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
CML on Gleevec but not taking, CKD (baseline Cr 1.6), who
initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting
on [**2753-4-10**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to
untreated CML. Of note, she had not been taking her Gleevec for
6 weeks because of side effects of malaise and GI discomfort.
Her hospital course was notable for starting Gleevec with more
GI symptoms which caused a decrease in her WBC count. They also
discontinued dofetilide due to worsening renal failure on [**4-17**].
On [**4-18**], she developed intractable V tach in the 130s with
pressures in the 90s/50s that was not easily amenable to pacer
override by EP. She was transferred to the CCU for further
management of her v tach.
In the CCU, she complains of mild dyspnea at rest, palpitations.
She denies CP or light-headedness. She was in sinus prior to
transfer, but en route returned into v tach in the 130s with
pressures in the 90s/50s. EP was called again who tried again to
override pace the v tach successfully. However, v tach recurred
and this needed to be repeated 2 more times. Amiodarone 100mg IV
ONCE bolus plus 1mg/min drip x 6 hours, then 0.5mg/min bolus x
18 hours was started. Electrolyte panel returned showing
hypokalemia of 3.2 and hypomagnesemia of 1.7. This was repleted
immediately with K 10mg IV ONCE, and K 40mg PO ONCE and
magnesium 4gm IV ONCE. Because the v tach developed at a sinus
rate of 78, the pacer was set to 85bpm to override the
ventricular ectopic focus with an automated 8 time override
mechanism.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies nause, vomitting, diarrhea,
constipation. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope (except on
presentation).

IMAGING/STUDIES:

NCHCT [**2753-4-10**]: There is no acute hemorrhage, large areas of
edema, large masses or mass effect. Periventricular white matter
hypodensities consistent with [**Month/Day/Year 3720**] small vessel ischemic
changes. Additional hypodensities noted within the basal ganglia
bilaterally are likely due to old lacunar infarcts. There is
preservation of normal [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is likely due to
age-related parenchymal atrophy. Visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are clear. Soft tissues of the orbits and
nasopharynx are within normal limits. Mild calcification of the
cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries is noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
Abd U/S [**2753-4-13**]: 1. Nodular liver, compatible with cirrhosis,
and splenomegaly indicative of portal hypertension.
2. Stable hepatic hemangioma.
3. Cholelithiasis, without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
4. Simple bilateral renal cysts.
.
CT Abd/Pel [**4-14**]:
FINDINGS: Small bilateral pleural effusions are new on this
study. Heart
size is enlarged with pacer leads noted within the right
ventricle.
Atelectasis is also noted in the lower lung lobes.
ABDOMEN: In segment VII of the liver, there is a 14 x 13
well-circumscribed
hypodensity that is of a fat density, this is increased in size
from previous study; however, microscopic fat suggests a benign
lesion. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is seen. Large
gallstones are seen within the gallbladder, but there is no
gallbladder distention or wall thickening. The spleen is
enlarged, measuring 13.6 mm in its longest axis. Pancreas is
normal appearing showing no masses, cysts or calcifications. In
the right adrenal gland, there is a 6 x 9 mm nodule with
macroscopic fat most consistent with myelolipoma. The left
adrenal gland is normal appearing. The kidneys enhance with and
excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of masses. The
small and large intesting demonstrate no evidence of
obstruction, wall thickening, or masses. Diverticulosis without
evdience of diverticulitis is seen in the sigmoid colon. No
lymphadenopathy is seen. The aorta, IVC, portal vein, and their
major branches appear patent.
BONES: An L4 vertebroplasty is seen. Severe degenerative changes
are seen
throughout the lumbar spine. No lytic or sclerotic lesions are
seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Small new bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
3. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Enlarged spleen.
.
CXR [**4-15**]: PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were compared
to [**2753-4-10**]. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Pacemaker leads
terminate in right atrium and right ventricle, the right
ventricular lead being pacemaker defibrillator. There is
interval progression of vascular engorgement, upper zone
redistribution of the vasculature and bilateral perihilar
opacities in conjunction with increased pleural effusion,
findings consistent with interval development of interstitial
pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.

Brief Hospital Course:
BMT COURSE:

Ms [**Known patient lastname 4278**] was admitted to BMT for her uncontrolled CML, as she
had been off Gleevec secondary to side effects.  She was
prescribed dasatinib in the interval, but she never filled this
prescription. She described her side effects as having nausea,
abdominal discomfort, and periorbital edema.  While on the BMT
service, we restarted her Gleevec at 400 mg daily but given as 4
100 mg pills rather than the larger 400 mg tablet, she was
better able to tolerate the smaller pills.  On one occasion, we
tried the larger pill and she had severe abdominal pain.  We did
obtain a CT scan with PO contrast to evaluate for any
obstruction but no significant abnormalities were seen.  On
Gleevec, her WBC continued to improve considerably from 170 ->
below 90.  Tumor lysis labs remained negative.

Coumadin was initially held because of its interaction with
Gleevec.

Due to her initial renal failure, her lasix dose, which she
takes 40 mg PO daily, was held.  Over the course of her
hospitalization on BMT, her renal function improved, and
secondary to hydration, she developed pulmonary edema,
presenting with orthopnea and shortness of breath.  She was
restarted on lasix and given IV diuresis over [**4-15**] - [**4-17**] with
significant improvement with a return of her oxygen status to
baseline.  Her dofetilide was also contraindicated at admission
secondary to renal failure and was held.  She remained in normal
sinus rhythm for the first week on the BMT service.  She then
went into a slow, sustained ventricular tachycardia on [**4-18**],
during which she was asymptomatic.  The ventricular tachycardia
lasted for 60 beats with a duration of ~ 20-30 seconds.  Her
defibrillator/pacer managed to bring her back into a regular
sinus rhythm and rate after several attempts to pace.  However,
upon repeat instance of asymptomatic, slow, sustained VT the
next day, she was transferred to the CCU for further management
of her VT.

CCU COURSE: In the CCU, the pt came in Vtach in the 130s
(probably converting in the field) with pressures in the
90s/50s. EP was called, and tried to override pace the v tach
successfully. However, v tach recurred and this needed to be
repeated 2 more times. Amiodarone 100mg IV ONCE bolus plus
1mg/min drip x 6 hours, then 0.5mg/min bolus x 18 hours was
started.  Electrolyte panel returned showing hypokalemia of 3.2
and hypomagnesemia of 1.7. This was repleted immediately with K
10mg IV ONCE, and K 40mg PO ONCE and magnesium 4gm IV ONCE.
Because the v tach developed at a sinus rate of 78, the pacer
was set to 85bpm to override the ventricular ectopic focus with
an automated 8 time override mechanism. The override pacer
function was set to override pace at 128bpm, with shocking after
8 attempts. Amio was continued. The patient's v tach was thought
to be triggered by electrolyte abnormalities and stopping
dofetelide [**2-17**] renal failure. On [**2753-4-20**] just past midnight, the
patient developed V tach again while on amio. She remained
hemodynamically stable (only has sx of palpitations) Lidocaine
was started with a bolus then a drip with successful conversion.
Gtt stopped on [**2753-4-20**]. Of note, pt had WBCs in urine and was
started on ceftriaxone for UTI on [**2753-4-20**]. Lasix restarted
[**2753-4-21**], and electrolytes checked twice daily thereafter without
significant derangement.  The patient was then transferred to
the medicine service to coordinate discharge planning.
.
MEDICINE WARDS COURSE:

VTach: Patient had no further episodes of ventricular
tachycardia. She was instructed to continue with her new cardiac
regimen of amiodarone and metoprolol, and follow-up with EP as
an outpatient.  Her prior cardiac regiment included dofetolide,
atenolol, digoxin and irbesartan.  Irbesartan was stopped
secondary to renal failure on admission, and digoxin was stopped
on transfer to CCU; these medications were not restarted on
discharge, and should be discussed with outpatient cardiologist.

UTI: Patient was initially started on ceftriaxone, which was
transitioned to oral cefpodoxime when species and sensitivities
from urine culture returned.  The patient was instructed to
complete a 7 day course of antibiotics to end on [**2753-4-27**].

Atrial Fibrillation: As noted above, patient had stopped
dofetolide and was started on amiodarone during her course in
the CCU.  She will consequently need periodic monitoring of
TFTs, LFTs and repeat PFTs as an outpatient.  Additionally,
coumadin was stopped during her hospitalization and restarted
several days prior to discharge.  At discharge her INR was 1.2.
She was instructed to have VNA draw INR on Monday [**4-27**], and the
results faxed to her PCP.

CML:  The patient was discharged on [**Month/Year (2) 29585**] 300 mg daily.  The
patient's pharmacy was contact[**Name (NI) **] and stated they would have the
medication ready for pickup on the day after discharge.  The
patient was instructed to take her dose of [**Name (NI) 29585**] prior to
leaving on the day of discharge, but refused, stating that she
would only take the medication at dinner time, when consuming a
full dinner (this was not available at the time of discharge).
Consequently, she missed her dose of [**Name (NI) 29585**] on the day of
discharge, but was given detailed instructions for obtaining and
taking her medication thereafter.
