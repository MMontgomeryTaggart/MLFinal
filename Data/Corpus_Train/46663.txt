HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
woman with a long history of aortic stenosis followed with
serial echocardiograms.  The patient is currently undergoing
evaluation for orthopedic procedure which prompted repeat TTE
and cardiac catheterization.  The new TTE and cardiac
catheterization revealed severe aortic stenosis with
preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and one vessel
coronary artery disease.  The patient is asymptomatic with no
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or edema, but is very
sedentary secondary to degenerative joint disease.  No
history of cerebrovascular accident of transient ischemic
attack.  No history of atrial fibrillation.  The patient
denies claudication.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortic stenosis
2.  Coronary artery disease
3.  Degenerative joint disease
4.  History of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3202**] disease diagnosis

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Open reduction internal fixation of right hip
2.  Cesarean section
3.  Total abdominal hysterectomy
4.  Left knee scope
5.  Carpal tunnel surgery
6.  Breast biopsy

PHYSICAL EXAM:
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Murmur radiating to
bilateral carotids.
LUNGS:  Clear
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Slightly obese, soft, nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, no edema, palpable pulses bilaterally.

LABS:  Hematocrit 30.3, white count 8.6, platelets 266.
Chem-7 144.0, 102, 29, 24, 1.0 and 113.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**3250-1-25**] and was
taken to the Operating Room on [**3250-1-26**] for an aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft x1 with
saphenous vein graft to the RCA.  A #23 CE Bovine pericardial
valve was used for the aortic valve repair.  Postoperatively,
the patient did well and was transferred to the CSRU.

On postoperative day #1, the patient's nitroglycerin drip was
weaned off.  The patient's Swan-Ganz catheter was removed and
the patient's chest tube was removed.  The patient was
transferred to the floor on postoperative day #1.

On postoperative day #2, the patient continued to do well,
but was noted to be atrial fibrillation.  An amiodarone bolus
was started and the patient was started on amiodarone po tid.
On postoperative day #2, the patient was seen by physical
therapy who felt that at that time she might need cardiac
rehabilitation.

On postoperative day #3, the patient continued to do well and
her wires were removed.  The patient was still in atrial
fibrillation, but with a rate of approximately 80.

On postoperative day #4, the patient was in sinus rhythm with
a rate of 73.  Plans were made for discharge to
rehabilitation the following day.  On the evening of
postoperative day #4, the patient had nausea and bilious
emesis.  An obstruction series was obtained and the patient
looked as though she had small bowel obstruction with dilated
loops of small bowel and [**Hospital3 126**] facility.  An
nasogastric tube was placed.  The patient was made NPO and
started on intravenous fluids.  The patient was given a
Fleet's enema and multiple Dulcolax suppositories for
significant stool impaction seen on the KUB.

The patient was continued NPO with intravenous fluids until
postoperative day #8 when the patient began passing gas
spontaneously.  The patient's nasogastric tube was removed on
postoperative day #8.  The patient was started on sips of
clears.  The patient was seen again by physical therapy who
felt that at this time the patient was independent and could
be discharged to home without rehabilitation.

On postoperative day #9, the patient was advanced to a
regular diet.  Plans for discharge were made for
postoperative day #10, [**3250-2-5**].  The patient was told that
she should probably see her outpatient gastroenterologist for
work up, as this small bowel obstruction questioned cancer vs
adhesions from prior abdominal surgery.
The patient was discharged to home on [**3250-2-5**] in good
condition on the following medications:
1.  Colace 100 mg po bid
2.  Mobic 7.5 mg po qd
3.  Lipitor 30 mg po q hs
4.  Amiodarone 400 mg po bid x7 days, then amiodarone 400 mg
po qd x7 days, then off
5.  Percocet 5/325 1 to 2 tablets po q 4 to 6 hours prn
6.  Lopressor 50 mg po bid

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post AVR
2.  Coronary artery bypass graft x2

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17500**] in
four weeks and with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 29254**], in three to four weeks.
The patient had been previously scheduled for colonoscopy.
She was advised to keep this appointment.
