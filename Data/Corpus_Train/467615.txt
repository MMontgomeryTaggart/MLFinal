   Assessment and Plan
   61-year-old man with ESRD on dialysis MWF, liver disease, seizure
   disorder presented from [**Hospital3 **] facility with 2-3 days of
   diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.
   1. Resp failure- intubated for airway protection, extubated
   successfully yest pm
   -can dc h2 blocker
   2. Acute GI illness- most concerning for viral gastroenteritis
   (especially norovirus given ongoing infections at his facility)
   - contact precautions
   - hold off on abx for now
   - IVF to support volume loss
   - can start po as tolerated following HD cath as below
   3. Seizures- seized in ED, broke, then vomited. Phenytoin level low at
   5.8; unclear compliance at facility.
   - continue phenytoin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam
   - f/u neuro recs, may need MRI brain
   4. HTN- suboptimal control
   - cont home meds, incr nifedipine to 90 XR [**Hospital1 **] if not controlling
   - IV anti-hypertensive as needed
   5. ESRD- Cr. 6.0
   - HD today; to get line changed
   - f/u renal recs
   6. Pulm nodule- RUL, FDG avid, concern for malig; per email discussion
   w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1099**], would ask thoracics to comment on whether any inpatient
