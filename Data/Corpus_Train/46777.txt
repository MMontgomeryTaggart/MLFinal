Brief Hospital Course:
# DKA/HHS:  Patient presented with glucose of 1025 and DKA
symptoms.  DKA likely caused by not taking insulin vs. cdiff
causing dehydration. Patient was started on insulin gtt in the
ED, and admitted to MICU for management of DKA.  Gap closed on
the next day.  Insulin gtt was discontinued, and patient was
transferred to the floor with her outpatient insulin regimen.
Patient's [**Month/Day/Year 118**] glucose was well-controlled on discharge.
Because she got into a big fight with her husband on the day of
presentation, patient was also seen by social work who provided
support.  Patient will follow up at the [**Hospital 93**] clinic the day
after discharge.  An appointment was made for her.
.
# C.diff colitis:  Patient was diagnosed with c. diff colitis on
[**1-6**], and she is in the middle of a 2 week course of PO flagyl.
 Patient continues to complain of abdominal tednerness,
especially in the left side, no rebound, no elevated WBC.
Patient states she initially had seen [**Month/Year (2) 118**] in her stool, which
has resolved.  Her abdominal pain and diarrhea are improving.
Patient's abdominal pain was controlled with tylenol.
.
# ARF: Patient's baseline Cr 1.1-1.2, she presented with
creatinine of 1.9. Likely [**3-17**] volume depletion. After getting IV
fluids, creatinine was back down to 1.1 on discharge.

in the MICU, which resolved spontaneously. EKG was essentially
unchanged from priors.  Cardiac enzymes were normal.

# Leg cramps:  Patient tends to get leg cramps when she is in
DKA.  Symptoms resolved on lorazepam.

narcotics for her neuropathy and was stopped after overdose and
falls.  PCP recommended that we limit narcotics as patient has
addiction history.  Home lidocaine patch and gabapentin were
continued.

hospital stay.  Home sumatriptan and butalbital-acet-caff PRN
