Service:  Cardiothoracic Service

IDENTIFICATION/REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 19131**] is an
80-year-old gentleman who has complained of shortness of
breath and fatigue over the past four years; worsening over
the past year.

He is postoperative admission scheduled for a redo mitral
valve replacement with a tricuspid valve replacement via a
right thoracotomy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old gentleman
status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2981**] and a
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2993**] with
complaints of shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue
over the past four years which has worsened over the past
year, prompting the patient to finally consent to surgery
which he has been refusing for at least one year prior to
this surgical date.

The patient had a cardiac catheterization done on [**7-18**]
that showed left main disease with a patent right coronary
artery stent a left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left
circumflex; both patent.  Severe mitral regurgitation and an
ejection fraction of 67%.  His echocardiogram done on [**7-13**]
showed right ventricular enlargement with moderate-to-severe
tricuspid regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
prior to admission revealed height was 5 feet 10 inches,
weight was 185 pounds, heart rate was 85 and irregular, blood
pressure was 106/62, respiratory rate was 24.  In general, a
pleasant male who appeared his stated age, in no acute
distress.  Skin was well hydrated.  Left cheek with a
half-dollar size lesion, purplish in color.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were equally round and
reactive to light with extraocular movements intact.
Positive glasses.  Positive hearing aid.  Positive upper and
lower dentures.  Normal buccal mucosa.  The neck was supple.
No jugular venous distention.  No thyromegaly.  No
lymphadenopathy.  No carotid bruits.  Chest with positive
crackles at the right base.  A sternal incision was
well-healed.  The sternum was stable.  Heart was irregular,
second heart sound and second heart sound, with a positive
[**2-22**] murmur heard best at the apex.  Slightly distant heart
sounds.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Normal active bowel sounds with a median abdominal incision
that was well-healed.  A colostomy bag and the ileostomy bag
were both intact.  Diffuse bilateral varicosities; right
greater than left.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II through
XII were grossly intact.  A nonfocal examination.  Femoral
pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ on
the right and 1+ on the left.  Posterior tibialis pulses were
not palpated.  Radial pulses were 2+ bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**8-16**], the patient was a direct
admission to the operating room at which time he underwent a
beating heart mitral valve replacement with a #27 Mosaic
valve and a tricuspid valve repair with a 32-mm ring.

The patient tolerated the operation and was transferred from
the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time of transfer, the patient was in atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 100 with a central venous pressure
of 13, a mean arterial pressure was 67.  He had propofol at
30 mcg/kg per minute, and epinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg per
minute.

The patient had an extended postoperative recovery in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  He received large
amounts of volume during his surgical repair.  The first
several days of his Intensive Care Unit admission were spent
diuresing the patient in an attempt to get him successfully
extubated.  During that time, he remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was weaned from all cardioactive drugs.  He did,
however, have frequent episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation;
for which he was initially loaded with amiodarone and later
switched to digoxin for rate control.

During the surgical repair of the patient's mitral valve and
tricuspid valve repair, he received large amounts of fluid,
and the first several days of the Intensive Care Unit were
spent with the patient undergoing vigorous diuresis in an
attempt to successfully extubate him.

On postoperative day eight, an attempt was made to extubate
the patient.  He rapidly failed the attempted extubation a
reintubated within 60 minutes of his initial extubation.  The
patient again weaned to CPAP following reintubation and
remained in the Intensive Care Unit ventilatory dependent.

On [**8-30**], the patient underwent a percutaneous
tracheostomy and percutaneous gastric tube placement.  He had
a #8 percutaneous tracheostomy placed at the bedside.  The
patient tolerated that procedure well and remained in the
Intensive Care Unit for the next several days; again,
undergoing ventilatory wean and ramping up of the patient's
tube feeds.  He was noted to have a large right loculated
pleural effusion.

On [**9-5**], he underwent a right videoscopic
thoracoscopy for removal of his loculated right pleural
effusion.  From that time forward, the patient remained in
the Intensive Care Unit with attempts being made to wean the
patient from the ventilator and get him to tracheostomy
collar.  The patient did tolerate ventilatory wean to a
pressure support of 5 and 5 during the day, resting at night,
with increased amounts of pressure support (up to 15) or
intermittent mandatory volumes with a rate of 8 to 10 breaths
per minute.  During this period of time, the patient was also
restarted on his anticoagulation given his history of atrial
fibrillation.

The patient is now postoperative day 27 from his valvular
surgery and on postoperative day seven from his tracheostomy
and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and it was felt
that he was stable and ready to be transferred to
rehabilitation for continuing weaning from his ventilator.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  A review of the patient's
physical examination at this time is as follows;  temperature
was 99.8, heart rate was 100 in atrial fibrillation, blood
pressure was 129/50, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen
saturation was 100% (that was with pressure support of 10,
positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, and 40% FIO2).  His
tidal volume with those settings was a tidal volume of
between 450 and 500, and his respiratory ranges 20 to 25.
Neurologically, the patient was alert and oriented.  He
followed commands and moved all extremities.  He does have
periods of agitation, and he felt frustrated that he could
not eat or talk.  Cardiovascularly, he had a heart rate from
80 to 100, in atrial fibrillation.  Second heart sound and
second heart sound with no murmurs.  The patient had a
well-healed old sternal incision.  Respiratory revealed he
had a #8 Portex tracheostomy.  He remained on CPAP 40%, 5 of
positive end-expiratory pressure, 10 of pressure support,
oxygen saturations were 96% to 100%.  He had scattered
rhonchi throughout, and no rales.  Suctioned for thick tan
secretions.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.  Tube feeds via his
gastrectomy tube at a goal rate.  He also had an intact
colostomy drainage bag.  He had an ileal loop that had a
collection bag that was intact, draining yellow urine with
some sediment in it.  Endocrine wise, the patient was
receiving sliding-scale insulin to cover blood sugars of
greater than 150.  He had a right thoracotomy with clean
margins, a small amount of sanguinous drainage from the upper
portion of that incision.
