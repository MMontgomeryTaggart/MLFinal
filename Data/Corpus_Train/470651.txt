TITLE:  EP staff [**Location (un) 9454**]
   Reviewed note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from this AM and discussed plan with team
   Self-extubated yesterday.  Initially with respiratory acidosis, but
   then with NIPV greatly improved.  Did not use any NIPV over night and
   slept ok.  This AM feels very good.  Breathing much better then
   pre-ablation.  No cough, chest pain, or edema.
   On tele appeared to be in AFib with controlled vent rate yesterday
   afternoon and overnight.  This AM looks to be in SR.  12 lead ECG
   confirms SR.  Carotid massage also performed with confirms SR since
   clearly visible sinus P wave after a pause.
   VSS, afeb
   WA, NAD
   JVP <10
   CTA bilat, no wheeze/crackles
   Reg rhythm
   Soft abd
   No edema, Right groin ok
   ABG improved at 1:30am close to baseline likely
   A/P: s/p Aflutter ablation, PAF, COPD, DM, morbid obeisity, respiratory
   distress
   -          respiratory status appears significantly improved.
   Appreciate Pulm recs
   -          tx with course of steroids PO as suggested by pulm
   -          CXR from this am with relatively clear lungs, no effusion
   -          PAF so will definitely need to continue Coumadin- will order
   an event monitor through [**Location (un) 9454**] to determine burden of PAF
   -          Would restart diltiazem at 180mg daily since HR about 100 in
   AF
   -          Have pt ambulate this AM and check HR, stability and O2
   sat.  If all is well and he remains feeling well, then he can
   potentially be discharged to home later this afternoon.
   -          Pt should call to make f/u appt with me in [**3-31**] weeks
   -          He needs to see his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-29**] weeks and have oupt pulm f/u
   at [**Location (un) 9454**]
   -          After oupt visit with me, will likely repeat echo looking
   for change in EF
