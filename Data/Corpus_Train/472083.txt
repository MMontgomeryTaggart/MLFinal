TITLE:
   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Continues to be intermittently agitated, but no purposeful movement.
   Oxygenation stable.  Lasix gtt increased to effect more UOP.  This
   morning comfortable off sedation.  Sputum cx (+)Klebsiella.  C.diff
   (-). WBC 16K, Hct 26%, plt 113K.
   Physical Examination
   Tmax 100.4, afebrile now.  103/55 on vasopressin.  HR 105.
   Vent: ACV 280x25-PEEP8-60%
   CVP ~13
   PA 55/28
   CI 2.7
   I/O -300cc
   appears comfortable, no response to voice, winces to pain
   otherwise as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   Medical Decision Making
   76F, critically ill following a massive anterior MI with VT arrest and
   anoxic encephalopathy.  She has been more hemodynamically stable, but
   is now febrile and is still unresponsive.  O/w assessment as per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Today's plan is:
          Continue antibiotics for presumed pneumonic, send another C.
   difficile
          Aggressive diuresis
          Limit sedation, titrate to comfort
          Try pressure support ventilation
          D/C PA catheter; replace with triple lumen
   Above will be discussed with family members, next of [**Doctor First Name 21**] or health care
   proxy.
   DNR status discussed. Other: as per prior note; unchanged.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
