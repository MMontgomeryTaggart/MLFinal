LAD

TTE ([**2624-7-23**])
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with fcal
hypokinesis of the mid septum and distal inferior walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

lesion and plan to medically manage the remaining lesions.  Her
aspirin was increased to 325 mg po qdaily.  She was started on
plavix 150 mg PO daily for 7 days followed by 75 mg daily for at

cardioprotective antihypertensives which can be adjusted per her
cardiologist or PCP

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure caring for you at the [**Hospital1 1890**]. You were admitted for a heart attack (an
ST-elevation MI) and went directly to the catheterization lab
where a stent was placed in one of your coronary arteries - your
left anterior descending artery. Your EKG and cardiac enzymes
after the cath procedure were all improved. We changed several
of your medications to help improve your heart health. The most
important medications are aspirin and Plavix - these medications
will help keep your stent patent. Take Plavix every day and do
not stop the medication unless directed by your cardiologist. It
will be important for you to watch your diet and to exercise to
prevent a second heart attack.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
We INCREASED Aspirin to 325 mg per day
We INCREASED Atorvastatin to 80 mg per day
We STARTED Plavix - 150 mg for the next 5 days, then 75 mg per
day for at least 1 year
We STARTED Lisinopril 5 mg per day
We STARTED Metoprolol Succinate 25 mg per day
Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg as needed for chest pain. Please
call your cardiologist office as well.
.
The information for follow-up is listed below.

Followup Instructions:
It will be important for you to have a cardiologist. The
cardiologist who performed your catheterization was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 225**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3666**]. To set up an appointment with him, please call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 27154**]. If you choose to see a cardiologist closer to
home, one recommendation is Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 **]- [**Location (un) **]. Her
office # is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6167**].
.
You should also call Dr.[**Name (NI) 31107**] office to make an appointment
to see her this week so that she is up to date about your recent
hospitalization and medication changes.
