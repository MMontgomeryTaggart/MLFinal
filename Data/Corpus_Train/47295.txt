CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process

[**3140-2-6**] TTE:
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. LV systolic
function appears depressed with inferior, inferolateral and
apical hypokinesis/?akinesis (however views suboptimal;
estimated ejection fraction ?35-40). Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The aortic valve is not
well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

[**3140-2-6**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
3 vessel
coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a 60% distal ulcerated
lesion.
The LAD had a widely patent previously placed stent.  The origin
of the
LCx had an 80% stenosis.  The proximal RCA was 90% stenosed,
with a 100%
distal RCA occlusion and left to right collaterals.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures, with RVEDP and LVEDP of 20 and 27 mm Hg,
respectively.  Mean
PCWP was elevated at 19 mm Hg.  Systemic arterial pressures were
low
with aortic systolic pressure of 92 mm Hg and mean arterial
pressure of
64 mm Hg.  Cardiac index was 3.07 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation and a
large
area of anteroapical and inferoapical dyskinesis.  Estimated
left ventricular ejection fraction was 35%.
4.  40 cc IABP was placed in the setting of extensive myocardial
infarction, hypotension, and impending CABG.

SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
REASON FOR EXAM: Elevated white blood count and altered mental

Comparison is made with prior study [**3140-2-13**].
Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by low lung volumes, unchanged
from prior study. The patient has been extubated. There is no
pneumothorax. The right lung is clear. There is a small left
pleural effusion. Ill-defined opacity in the left base is
persistent, could be atelectasis or pneumonia. Patient is post

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed

Conclusions
PRE CPB No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the
right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with apical severe hypokinesis/akinesis. No
apical thrombus is seen. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly to moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %). The
right ventricle displays normal mid and basal function with mild
to moderate focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. An intra-aortic balloon pump is seen in
the descending aorta with its tip 2 cm below the distal aortic
arch.
POST-CPB The focal wall abnormalities noted in the pre-bypass
study are unchanged. The mitral regurgitation may be slightly
improved. No other significant changes.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted as transfer from [**Hospital6 1919**] with acute MI on
[**2-5**]. Brought to cath lab on [**2-6**]  found to have left main and
2VD/EF 35%. Intra Aortic Ballon Pump placed at that time. CT
surgery consulted and patient brought to operating room on [**2-7**]
for coronary artery bypass grafts. Patient tolerated the surgery
well and [**Hospital 24964**] transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable
condition. He remained intubated and hemodynamically stable on
the day of surgery. On POD1 the IABP was weaned and removed,
after which his sedation was stopped. An attempt to wean from
ventilator was unsuccessful. On POD2 he was again weaned and
extubated however required reintubation because of agitation.
Neurology and psychiatry were consulted. The patient had ahead
CT that was negative as well as an MRI and Lumbar puncture that
were also negative. Over the next several days his neuro status
cleared and he was successfully extubated. He did remain
delerious for several additional days but was ultimately
transferred to the stepdown floor on POD 12. The patient also
experienced a Gout flare during this time, rheumatology was
consulted and he was started on Colchicine and Indocin. Over the
next several days he continued to make slow progress in his ADL
and ambulation and on POD 15 it was decided he was stable and
ready for discharge to [**Hospital 1532**] Rehab. He will followup with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 222**] in 4 weeks
