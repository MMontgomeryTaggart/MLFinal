Chief Complaint:
CODE STROKE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 83 yo M PMH presents as CODE STROKE.  History provided by
patient's wife.

Patient was usual state of health all yesterday when he went to

or speak to her.  She notes that he was having trouble getting
out of bed whereas he usually just jumps right out.  She did not
notice any facial distortion.

Upon EMS arrival, they noted left sided weakness particularly in
the leg.  Transported to [**Hospital1 4**] ED as CODE STROKE.  Due to
decreased alertness and not protecting airway, patient was
emergently intubated.

Called at 8:05am at bedside within minutes.

Imaging:
CTA [**8-31**]:
1. Perfusion-weighted images showing a large left middle
cerebral artery territory infarct.
2. Tapered narrowing of the lumen of the proximal cervical left
internal carotid artery is suggestive of a dissection. Complete
occlusion of the left internal carotid artery at both its
cervical and intracranial portions distal to the dissection.
3. Abrupt cut off of the contrast column within the A1 segment
of the left ACA, which is being filled by a prominent anterior
communicating artery. This abrupt cut off is suggestive of an
acute thromboembolism.
4. Reconstitution of the M3 and M4 branches of the left middle
cerebral artery presumably from leptomeningeal collaterals.

MRI/A [**8-31**]: Limited evaluation showing occlusion of the cervical
portion of the left internal carotid artery. Signal is seen
within portions of the intracranial left ICA and the proximal
left MCA, which may represent reconstitution of flow since the
preceding CTA versus signal from thrombosis.

TEE [**9-1**]: Probable left atrial appendage thrombus. Patent
foramen ovale.

CT Head [**9-2**]: Marked progression to parenchymal edema involving
the entire left cerebral hemisphere with new 16 mm subfalcine
herniation and uncal herniation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 31402**] was an 83-year-old man who presented with aphasia
and right hemiparesis, and who was found to have a left MCA
stroke. His hospital course is as follows:

1. Neuro: L MCA stroke. Initially, this appeared to be isolated
to the superior division of the L MCA. He was not a candidate
for tPA as his last known well time was eight hours prior to
presentation, when he went to bed. There was an appearance on
CTA of dissection of the L MCA, so he was started on IV heparin.
Unfortunately, over the next 24-48 hours, his mental status
declined, becoming less responsive even when off sedation.
Repeat CT scans showed involvement of the entire L MCA
territory. After ~72 hours, a repeat CT showed significantly
increased edema with subfalcine and uncal herniation. His family
was present and decided to make him comfort measures only (CMO).
Care was withdrawn, including extubation, although his family
requested that the fluids continue. He died within hours of
extubation.
