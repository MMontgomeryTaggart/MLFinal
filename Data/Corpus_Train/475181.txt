   forced open.  MMM, oropharynx clear.
   Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD.
   Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi,
   though poor insiratory effort and will only permit anterolateral exam
   currently.
   CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, [**2-24**] SM at LUSB without
   radiation.  L sided ICD with overlying ecchymosis, area somewhat firm,
   no erythema or warmth or fluctuance.  Ecchymosis over left
   chest/breast.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 59F with CAD s/p multiple PCIs, ischemic CHF, Type
   I DM, Hx of Anoxic Brain Injury, Anxiety, Depression who presents with
   altered mental status sp ICD placement for ventricular tachycradia.
   .
   # Delerium: Most likley multifactorial in the setting of recent
   hosptialization, poor po intake, and benzodiazepines. After discussion
   with husband it is clear that at baseline patients thinking is clear
   and this is a major change. Husband notes [**Name2 (NI) 11238**] episodes of
   hallucination/agitation/anxiety while patient was in the ICU at
   [**Hospital1 924**] with intermittent lucidity. Patient has been afebrile.
   Reports of CT head with new ?stroke from prior in [**Month (only) 94**] at OSH. Pt
   with multiple psychiatric medication which were stopped at OSH with
   stated improvement. During her stay she recieved ativan prn agitation
   which her husband stated controlled her anxiety/agitation however often
   sedated her during the interum. Patient takes poor PO during this time
   and has denied PO meds here.
   -  Repeat CT Head
   - Normalize sleep wake cycle
   - Minimize sedating medications

   - FU CT Head from [**Hospital1 924**]. Report of new ?stroke in thalamus.

   # Hypernatremia: Most likely secondary to hypovolemia. Patient not
   taking PO. Free Water deficit 2 Liters.
   - D5W at 75 cc hour for 2 liters.
   .
   # Ventricular arrhythmias sp ICD placement: EKG stable from prior.
   - Telemetery
   - Continue Beta Blocker, IV if not taking
   - Avoid QT prolonging medications.
   - Agressive repletion of potassium/magnesium

   # Depression/Anxiety: Will DC Abilify/Remeron given current level of
   confusion.

   # Pacer Pocket Hematoma: No warmth, erythema, or tenderness on
   palpation. Unlikely infection. No leukocytosis or fever. Follow for
   now.

   mexiletine. Trending down since mexiletine dc'd.

   elevated free t4 will decrease Synthroid replacement currently.

   # Coccyx/Heel Ulcerations: Chronic. Husband provides wound care at home
   and notes stability of wounds. Right heel ulceration with some mild
   erythema. Patient afebrile without leukocytosis.
