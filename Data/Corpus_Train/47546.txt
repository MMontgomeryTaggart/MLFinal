Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service. Orthopedics was
consulted for a T1 fracture and they felt it was not acute and
needed no intervention. His coumadin was held and he was given
FFP and vitamin K to reverse his INR and it normalized to 1.3 on
[**6-10**]. He had a repeat CT head on [**6-9**] that showed no new
hemorrhage and remained stable. He did become somewhat aggitated
and required restraints on the evening of [**6-9**]. Social work was
consulted per wife's request as she has been finding it
difficult to care for him at home and to discuss her options of
nursing facilities. On [**6-11**], patient remained stable. PT/OT was
consulted and atrius was called to help move him forward to a
nursing home facility.

On [**6-12**], patient became slightly agitated and disoriented
however this delerium began to clear the following day and he
became more cooperative during the remainder of his hospital
stay.

At the time of discharge on [**6-14**] he was tolerating a diet,
ambulating with a walker, afebrile with stable vital signs.
