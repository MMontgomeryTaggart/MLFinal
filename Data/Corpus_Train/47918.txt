HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3519**] is a 77-year-old man
with a history of coronary artery bypass graft times two,
aortic valve replacement, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and
recurrent ventricular tachycardia, who was transferred to the
[**Hospital6 817**] for an electrophysiology
study and a possible ablation of ventricular tachycardia from
an outside hospital after recurrent episodes of ventricular
tachycardia setting off his ICD four times in the past three
days.  The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation since the [**2859**] and has had episodes of
ventricular tachycardia for the past few years.  He was
recently admitted to [**Hospital6 817**] in
[**Month (only) 51**] with fatigue and bradycardia with a heart rate in the
40s and [**1-11**] AV block.  During that admission, he went into
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia treated with intravenous
lidocaine.  He then went back into ventricular tachycardia
and had a five second pause and a dual chamber ICD pacemaker
was placed.  At that time, he was able to end his episodes of
ventricular tachycardia with overdrug pacing.  He was sent
home on sotalol and mexiletine.  At a clinic visit two weeks
later, his ICD was interrogated and he was found to have had
multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia.  He was sent to
the Electrophysiology Laboratory for ventricular tachycardia
ablation.  They found two foci and ablated one.  The second
one was not ablated because it was to close to his
replacement valve.  The ablation procedure was [**2891-7-25**].

After discharge, he was fine until Saturday when he felt his
heart beating rapidly and he felt lightheaded.  He presented
to the [**Location (un) 1601**] Emergency Department but was sent home because
there were no beds.  He felt his ICD shock him twice on
[**Last Name (LF) 133**], [**7-30**], and twice again yesterday [**7-31**].  He
presented to [**Hospital 1155**] Hospital at 5 p.m. [**7-31**] with a
rapid heart rate and chest tightness and was found to be in
ventricular tachycardia.  His ventricular tachycardia was
occasionally able to be stopped by overdrug pacing, but was
not consistently stopped.  He was started on a lidocaine drip
and transferred to [**Hospital6 817**] for
further electrophysiological evaluation.

On admission, he denied chest pain, chest tightness,
palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, headache,
fever, chills, nausea and vomiting.  He also denied
hematemesis, hematochezia but says he has dark stools because
he takes iron at home.  He denied urinary difficulties,
indigestion, weight loss.  Has a history of claudication in
his legs but denies rest pain.  He also denies orthopnea.

at age 55.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Pulse 68.  Respiratory rate 17.
Afebrile.  Blood pressure 106/40.  02 saturation 97% on two
liters.  Generally, he was awake and alert, [**Location (un) 70**] the
newspaper.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements full.
Oropharynx clear.  Moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  He has a
scar on the right neck from CEA, no jugular venous
distention, supple.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 with
a loud mechanical valve murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities: He had a

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 4.9,
hematocrit 25.4, platelets 166,000.  Sodium 133, potassium
4.1, chloride 99, bicarbonate 21, BUN 22, creatinine 1.5,
glucose 92, magnesium 1.9, LDH 251, CK 33, PT 22.7, INR 3.5,
PTT 150.  Other laboratory studies during the course of
admission including iron studies with TIBC of 304, ferritin
121, reticulocyte count of 4, haptoglobin of less than 20.
Electrocardiogram on admission showed atrial sensing,
ventricular pacing at 70 beats per minute.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 77-year-old with a
history of coronary artery bypass graft times two, AVR,
atrial fibrillation and recurrent ventricular tachycardia
status post ICD pacer placement admitted now after a recent
ventricular tachycardia ablation last week for further
electrophysiology evaluation.

1. Cardiovascular:  Rhythm.  Patient has recurrent
ventricular tachycardia.  We discontinued lidocaine and
started mexiletine at 130 mg t.i.d.  Electrophysiology
evaluated his ICD and changed various settings which will
hopefully make the patient less likely to be shocked and
hopefully will be able to terminate his episodes of recurrent
ventricular tachycardia without being defibrillated.
Throughout admission, the patient had intermittent episodes
of ventricular tachycardia which were terminated without
being defibrillated.  The patient was started on mexiletine
150 mg t.i.d.  His amiodarone was continued at 400 mg q.d.
and it was decided that recurrent ventricular tachycardia
ablation would be not undertaken at this time.

2.  Pump:  The patient had an echocardiogram during the
course of admission which showed the left atrium mildly
dilated, left atrium also elongated, the right atrium
moderately dilated.  There was moderate symmetric left
ventricular function.  The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated, overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depression.  Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include akinesis of the inferior septum and
inferior walls at the base and mid ventricular levels.
Lateral wall and apex demonstrated moderate hypokinesis.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
A bibasilar aortic valve prosthesis is present.  Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.  Moderate to severe 3+ mitral
regurgitation.  The patient was continued on enalapril and
Lopressor for his cardiomyopathy.

3.  Valve disease:  The patient is status post aortic valve
replacement.  His Coumadin was held during his admission for
possible electrophysiology study.  He was started on a
heparin drip.  The patient was then restarted on his Coumadin
at 3 mg q.p.m. with an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.5 and discharged
on Lovenox.  His PT and INR will be checked as an outpatient
two days after discharge.

4.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient has a history of
coronary artery bypass graft times two.  He is on Zocor and
aspirin.  He is also on Imdur for angina.  None of these
medications were changed.

5.  Pulmonary:  The patient was saturating well on two liters
of nasal cannula, then saturating well on room air.  The
patient has no home 02.  Because the patient was started on
amiodarone some time in the last month without any prior
pulmonary function tests, the patient was sent for pulmonary
function tests during this admission.

6.  Renal:  The patient is status post a right renal
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  His baseline
creatinine is 1.6 to 2.3.  Creatinine remained stable around
1.5 throughout the hospital course.

7.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had no issues.  He was
started on Zantac.

8.  Infectious Disease:  The patient remained afebrile
throughout his hospital course with a stable white count.

9.  Hematology:  The patient has a history of chronic anemia.
He is on iron at home.  His anemia is most likely due to iron
deficiency, possibly some slight hemolysis due his aortic
valve replacement, as well as possibly renal disease.

10. Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient remained
euvolemic.  His electrolytes were followed and repleted as
needed.  Patient ate well during the hospital course.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.
