   Assessment and Plan
   72 year-old female with PMHx of DM, aortic stenosis, dCHF, and new
   diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who was admitted from cardiology
   clinic for CHF exacerbation and transferred to the CCU for atrial
   fibrillation with RVR.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt arrived on the floor and developed RVR with
   inability to sustain a normal blood pressure. The floor team was
   limited in their use of metoprolol because of the patient's
   hypotension. She underwent cardioversion on the floor and then was
   transferred to the CCU for further monitoring. In the CCU, she had
   add
l episodes of Afib/RVR, treated by cardioversion once, digoxin
   once, and multiple fluid boluses. Last episode RVR [**2-14**] which resolved
   with fluid boluses. TSH 0.39. MI ruled out with 3 sets of enzymes. HR
   well controlled ranging 80s to 120s, improved from 130s previously. Pt
   complains only of occaissional short lived palpitations
   -continue amio loading
   -increasing Coumadin dose, as pt still subtherapeutic
   -starting lovenox bridge while patient is subtherapeutic
   -possible cardioversion this week, will need TEE first
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Heart Failure
 EF 50%.  Likely related to pt's
   atrial fibrillation.  Pt given PO lasix yesterday with good urine
   response. Still appears to be fluid overloaded on exam.
   - po lasix daily
   - treat Afib as above
   .
   # Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) Trace AR: Last Echo [**8-12**]
EF 50%
   - Can tolerate gentle diuresis.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Pt had a bump in her creatinine in the setting
   of starting lasix. Likely pre-renal. Creatinine improved at 0.9 but
   still above baseline of 0.7.
   - starting 20 mg PO Lasix daily, as above
   - restarting metformin, as below
   - continue holding lisinoptil
   .
   # Diabetes - On metformin at home. Was on ISS here.
   - restarting metformin today
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - Not entirely clear on home dose. TSH 0.39.
   - need to clarify home dose and likely decrease dose
   - holding thyroid hormone for now given amniodorone loading
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertension
 Normotensive this morning; borderline hypotensive
   overnight.
   - holding lisinopril, as above
