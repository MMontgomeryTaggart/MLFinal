IMAGING

CXR, pre-op ([**3092-1-3**]):
1. Tracheostomy cannula above the level of the clavicles within
the upper
trachea but rotated and potentially malpositioned.
2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CXR, post-op ([**3092-1-4**]):
A tracheostomy tube is in place, the tip lies approximately 16
mm above the carina. This appears to represent a change in the
tracheostomy tube compared with earlier the same day ([**3092-1-3**] at
9:59 a.m.).  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent but
unchanged. Some patchy  opacity in the left greater than right
suprahilar regions is unchanged. Some  bibasilar atelectasis is
also unchanged. Prominent pulmonary artery is again noted in
this individual with history of pulmonary arterial hypertension.


Left wrist plain films ([**3092-1-4**]):
1. No obvious fracture. If there has been significant trauma and
wrist pain  persists, then followup radiographs in [**7-12**] days
could help to assess for  resorption about an occult fracture.
2. Widening and ? slight offset at the distal radioulnar joint.
This could represent a post-traumatic finding, though it is of
indeterminate acuity.
3. Possible soft tissue swelling, best assessed by physical
exam.
4. First CMC and triscaphe joint degenerative changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
60F admitted on [**3092-1-3**] for tracheostomy malfunction. The patient
was taken to the operating room and, under direct laryngoscopy,
was found to have a dislodged tracheostomy.  The tracheostomy
was replaced with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5154**] tracheostomy piece without
complication.  The patient was subsequently admitted to the ICU
for ventilator management and close monitoring.

On hospital day #2 the patient was weaned off the ventilator to
trach collar.  Given her poor IV access, a PICC line was placed.
 She was transfused 1 unit PRBC for hematocrit 24.7, with
subsequent increase to 29.1.  Her anemia was attributed to
anemia of chronic disease given she had no evidence of active
bleeding.  Her transfusion was given in conjunction with IV
Lasix to avoid exacerbation of her congestive heart
failure/pulmonary edema.  She complained of left wrist pain, for
which plain films were obtained.  No fracture was identified.
Given her history of gout, her home allopurinol was restarted
once enteral access was obtained.

On hospital day #3 the patient went to IR for post-pyloric
advancement of a Dobhoff tube.  Nutrition was consulted with
recommendations for Replete with fiber tube feedings at a goal
of 55cc/hour.  She continued to remain stable from a hemodynamic
and respiratory standpoint and was deemed appropriate for
discharge back to rehab.

Discharge Instructions:
We appreciated the opportunity to partipate in your care at
[**Hospital1 52**]. As you transition to your extended care facility we
wanted to highlight several ongoing issues with your care:

1. Physical therapy: please work each day with the physical
therapy team. This will increase your strength and improve your
lung function.

2. Abdominal pain: your pain is similar to the chronic pain you
experienced prior to admission. The medical team has contact[**Name (NI) **]
your GI doctor  to discuss your hospitalization, but you should
also schedule a follow up appointment with your GI doctor within
the next several weeks to further evaluate and manage your
chronic abdominal
pain.

3. Obstructive sleep apnea: while you are on the vent you will
receive respiratory support while you are both awake and asleep.

When you are weaned from the vent you will need to continue
using your bipap machine while you are asleep. This is very
important as sleep apnea contributes to worsening of your
pulmonary function and heart failure.

4. Rehab course: we believe you are now ready to continue
rehabilitation from your illness at an extended care facility.
Please keep in mind that you were very sick while in the
hospital, and recovery may be prolonged despite not needing to
remain in the hospital at this time. To help guide what types of

things should prompt calling your primary care physician or
returning to the hospital, please refer to the information
listed below.


Followup Instructions:
1. Please follow up with your primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at

the following appointment that has been scheduled for you:
Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1402**], M.D. Date/Time: [**3092-1-19**] 10:20

2. Please follow up with the acute care surgery clinic in 2
