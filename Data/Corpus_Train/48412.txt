IMAGING:
[**3383-3-21**] PORTABLE CXR: IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with CHF
.
[**3383-3-22**] CXR:
Compared with one day earlier, the right suprahilar patchy
opacity is more extensive and patchy opacity in the right
cardiophrenic region is also more pronounced. However, I doubt
the presence of upper zone redistribution or significant CHF.
Minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region and right is
unchanged. No effusion is identified. No pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Doubt CHF. More extensive patchy opacities in the
right perihilar and right cardiophrenic regions.
.
[**3383-3-22**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis
of the right or left lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo female with history of afib with SSS on coumadin, HTN,
hyperlipidemia who presents from ALF with worsening dyspnea,
treated in MICU for NSTEMI, CHF and PNA.
.
# NSTEMI:  In the setting of her acute illness the patient
suffered an NSTEMI with Trop increasing from <.01 to peak of
0.77, since trending downward. Cardiology was consulted with
recommendation to treat comorbidities and maximize med regimen
without likely plan for cath. However, given NSTEMI exacerbated
by afib with RVR and history of likely tachy-brady, EP consulted
as well. Patient is currently well rate controlled with
Metoprolol with potential plan for PPM at some point in future.
.
# Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including PNA, CHF.  In the
MICU, the patient initially required BiPap for resp distress.
She was subsequently diuresed and started on broad spectrum
coverage abx (Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl) given fever on admission and
course pulmonary exam. With above treatment patient's fever
curve improved as did her resp status.  Antibiotics were then
narrowed to levofloxacin and she will complete a 14 day course
to finish on [**3383-4-7**].  Of note, she did have LLE swelling on
admission which has since resolved, but LENIs neg for DVT.
.
# CHF: Echo done in [**10-9**] with EF >70. Likely [**3-7**] diastolic
dysfunction.  She was initially diuresed aggressively, but her
diuretics were discontinued when she appeared clinically
euvolemic, if not mildly dry [**3-7**] to decreased PO intake.  Her
fluid status will need to be continually addressed while in
rehab with reinitiation of her diuretics as needed accordingly.
.
#. Pneumonia: was on vanc/zosyn/azithro in ICU for LLL opacity
on CXR. Changed to levaquin PO for ? CAP/asp.  She was not
covered for hospital acquired infection (gram negatives and
MRSA), but doubt that based on clinical status and CXR findings.
 She has remained afebrile without leukocytosis since initiation
of abx.  Her pulmonary exam remains rhonchorus and she has not
been able to clear her secretions well.  Chest PT was initiated
with improvement in her O2 saturation on room air.  Aggressive
pulmonary toilet should be continued in rehab as well.  If
clinical status were to deteriorate, broadening antibiotic
coverage to include hospital acquired infections is very
reasonable given her multiple hospital and rehab admissions.
Respiratory and blood cultures were negative.  She is to
complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin on [**3383-4-7**].  She was
maintaining oxygen saturations in the low to mid 90s (increasing
to high 90s with chest PT) at time of discharge.
.
#. COPD: likely experiencing exacerbation [**3-7**] pneumonia.
Although predominantly rhonchorus on exam, she did have
intermittent wheezing.  She was continued on advair,
albuterol/atrovent nebulizers, which have improved her
bronchospastic symptoms and exam findings.
.
#. CAD: Patient with troponin elevation, peak 0.77 and
subsequent downward trend. Likely a demand picture in setting of
afib with RVR, PNA, and CHF with resultant hypoxia in the unit.
She was started on plavix for anticipated cath but no plan for
that currently so it was discontinued.  She will be continued on
ASA and statin for discharge.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Known history of a. fib with history of
likely SSS, previously requiring temporary pacing.  Had 2
episodes of A-fib w/ RVR on [**3-27**], which were largely
unresponsive to IV lopressor, but broke with diltiazem 10-20 mg
IV.  She will be continued on PO metoprolol at 50mg QID.  Her
coumadin was originally held for the potential of PPM placement
by EP.  However, given her pulmonary status currently, there are
holding on PPM placement currently.  She does, however, have
outpatient follow up with EP on [**3383-6-4**] at which time this will
be readdressed.  Currently, she remains on heparin gtt and will
be restarted on coumadin.  Weight based heparin gtt (as included
in discharge paperwork) can be discontinued when her INR is
again therapeutic, but this will need to be followed in rehab.
.
#.  Hematuria:  While on the heparin gtt, she developed
hematuria via her foley 1 day prior to admission.  There were no
clots.  Hct and HD were entirely stable in this setting.  Her
foley catheter was discontinued and her UA did not reveal
evidence of infection.  She was able to void without difficulty
and she denied urinary symptoms.  A urine cx is currently
pending and should be followed up.  She should call [**Hospital1 52**]
urology at([**Telephone/Fax (1) 3161**] for a follow up appointment to further
evaluate this if persists.
.
#. Anemia: baseline HCT 25-30.  Stable throughout hospital
course.  Should be monitored at rehab given anticoagulation and
recent hematuria.
.
#. ARF:  She had a very mild bump in her creatinine to 1.2 (BL
creatinine nml) just prior to discharge and clinically on exam
appeared to be dry with dry MM.  Creatinine normalized on day of
d/c to 1.0 after small IV fluid bolus.  Prior to her creatinine
bump, she had been kept NPO for the potential PPM placement.
Her diet has since been restarted and she was given a small
fluid bolus (given known CHF and recent aggressive diuresis).
Her kidney function and fluid status should be monitored at
rehab as well.
.
#. Depression:  She was continued on Celexa per her outpatient
regimen.
.
#. FEN:  Low sodium, heart healthy diet, ground, thick liquids.
Given concern for aspiration pneumonia, she was evaluated by
speech and swallow twice during this stay and was cleared to
take PO (ground and thin liquids) diet without evidence of
aspiration.
.
#  On [**3383-4-1**], primary team was notified that patient had a bed
at [**Hospital **] rehab and she was discharged there.  However, upon
arrival to [**Hospital **] rehab, transport team was informed that there
was no bed available.  Thus, she was transferred back to [**Hospital1 52**]
in the care of original team and nursing staff.  She was
discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**3383-4-2**].
