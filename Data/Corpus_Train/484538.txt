   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old male with severe COPD on home 4L NC, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   CAD (s/p , GERD, depression and chronic back pain on multiple sedating
   pain medications and psychiatric medications who presented with AMS,
   hypercarbic respiratory distress.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory distress / COPD : Most likely etiology is
   narcotic and BZD induced respiratory depression atop of his usual COPD
   retainer status at baseline. Patient is taking fentanyl patch, Percocet
   & Ativan at home.  Unlikely an underlying infection with  COPD
   exacerbation given his normal WBC count, lack of fevers, and normal
   CXR. Also unclear if he is compliant with his home oxygen.
   .
   -plan to continue on 4L NC with goal O2 sats >90%
   -f/up interval CXR read today
   -f/up blood cultures
   -continue on albuterol, ipratropium nebs q4hrs PRN
   -continue current 20mg Prednisone for COPD, adding Azithromycin as well
   x 5 days
   -continue daily Advair
   -continue PPx Bactrim)
   .
   #agitation/confusion: Likely secondary to hypercarbia and narcotics as
   outlined above. Half life of recently removed fentanyl patches ( 2)
   still lingering x 24 hours. CT head r/o any acute process.
   -continue to monitor O2 sats, ABGs
   - place order for ativan PRN
   -can add PRN Haldol if becomes belligerent  or refractory to Ativan
   - consider repeat ABD
   .
   #Right sided weakness: Subtle weakness with right sided hand grasp,
   other CNs [**3-29**] all normal on exam. Neurology service saw patient in ED
   and felt no acute exam focal findings, CT head negative. Recommended a
   f/up CTA which was ordered in ED. Recent slurred speech resolved now
   and was most likely secondary to his narcotics.
   -ff/up additional neurology recs
   -repeat neuro exam in afternoon , currently unremarkable
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease: Past medical history significant for prior
   NSTEMI in [**3369**]. He has no c/o current chest pain or palpitations.
   -continue on telemetry
   -continue usual home daily ASA 81mg
   -continue daily pravastatin
   #. Hypertension: Currently normotensive and stable. BPs in
   120-130s/60-70s range.
   - continue on home Lisinopril 5 mg daily
   .
   #Depression: Mood stable. Denies any suicidal ideation.
   - continue Sertraline 50 mg
   - hold Ativan for now given recent over-sedation
   - SW consult
   .
   #. Chronic Back Pain:  Given concern for decreased respirations and
   somnolence with hypercarbia will hold sedating narcotics for now.
   Palliative and pain service now following.
   - f/up additional palliative team recs, appreciate input
   - continue on ATC Tylenol,
   - start lidocaine patch today
   -will add low dose PRN oxycodone once more stable
   -holding fentanyl patch and percocet
   -.
   #. GERD: Denies active reflux symptoms, stable without complaints.
   -continue on home Protonix 40mg PO daily
   .
   #BPH: urine output currently within normal limits, will plan to
   continue usual home Finasteride 5mg PO daily
   .
   #FEN:  cardiac diet
   #Access: got 20g and 22g
   #PPX: continue usual home PPI as above, bowel regimen with Senna,
   Colace, Miralax and Lactulose home regimen
   #Dispo: ICU for BIPAP, if stable and improves possible call out
   #Code: DNR/DNI, discussed with wife/HCP and patient
   **** WILL PLAN FOR DETAILED GOALS OF CARE DISCUSSION this afternoon
   with palliative care, attending and wife as patient seems near hospice
   level care now
