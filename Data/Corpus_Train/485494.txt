   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 FUNGAL INFECTION, OTHER
   Perianal skin
 .H/O CONSTIPATION (OBSTIPATION, FOS)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Assessment and Plan
   This 81-year-old woman was experiencing symptoms of worsened forward
   flow in the context of volume overload. Her heart failure is largely
   secondary to mitral regurgitation, worsened since her MVR in the mid
   [**2981**]. Diuresis is key
 with euvolemia her MR will likely improve,
   resulting in improved end-organ perfusion and likely enable her to go
   home with better urine output with oral diuretics.
   Heart Failure
   Mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of
   30%.Decompensated at present.  Previously no output to milrinone, lasix
   and phenylephrine. Stopped milrenone and added dopamine to lasix and
   phenylephrine and had good UOP to this (LOS 4L).  Pt is still volume
   overloaded with peripheral edema, but JVP no longer elevated. BP has
   been on the low side, limiting amount of diuresis possible.
   - decrease rate of lasix gtt for gentler diuresis (goal 1-1.5 L
   negative)
   - Continue dopamine at 1-3 mcg/kg/min
   - Continue to hold ACEI
   - Continue beta-blocker and amiodarone given arhythmogenic dopamine
   - strict I/O and daily weights
   - Low sodium diet, fluid restrict
   - goal is to get her to be able to get from bed to chair so she can go
   to home with hospice
   Tachy-Arrhythmia
    Responded to metoprolol and on amiodarone, without SVT since
   amiodarone started.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO amiodarone (400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks, 400 mg daily for [**12-19**]
   weeks, then 200 mg daily). Likely a life-long medication.
   - Maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Long history and likely active disease with decreased flow in the
   setting of hypotension. Had chest pressure in setting of SVT, but
   currently CP free.
   - Continue ASA 81
   Shock/Hypotension/Hypoperfusion
     Poor forward flow.  Baseline BP also appears low (systolic pressures
   in 80s at clinic). Diuresis also heavily contributing.
   - Improve forward flow
   - Pressors to support 90 - 100 mm Hg if necessary with lasix gtt
   NSTEMI
     Elevated troponins, CK-MB, anterior TWI on EKG felt to be in setting
   of acute illness, tachycardia leading to demand ischemia. Resolving.
   - continue ASA 81mg PO
   - off atorvastatin while LFTs abnormal
   - pain control as needed
   Subacute Renal Failure
     Creatinine still elevated above baseline 1.0. Possible prerenal
   component in setting of dehydration/chronic CHF with intravascular
   depletion.
   - Monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications; avoid nephrotoxins
   - Hold ACE-I
   Hepatitis
     Resolving. Elevated LFTs likely in setting of shock liver. Now
   trending down.
   Abdominal Pain
     Likely ischemic based on history and physiological substrate.
   Abdominal pain resolving; colitis likely ischemic. Holding off on abx
   as do not suspect infectious etiology. R heart failure also likely
   contributing.
   - Maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
   Guaiac positive stools in ED
     PR trauma versus ischemic colitis.
   - Follow Hct
   - repeat stool guiuac
   Obstructive lung disease/allergic rhinitis
   - Restart albuterol now stably free of arhythmia
   - Continue cromolyn spray, advair, ipratropium
   Anxiety
     Was ordered for two different PRN benzodiazepines - reduced to
   lorazepam only (stopped clonazepam PRN). Continue fluoxetine.
   Heel pain
     Unclear etiology and now resolved. No diabetes. No skin breakdown on
   exam.
   FEN:
   - No fluids, fluid restricted diet
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Low sodium heart healthy diet, PPI.
   Prophylaxis:
   -DVT Coumadin
   -Pain management with morphine PRN
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, Miralax, lactulose (hold for loose
   stool).

   CODE: DNR/DNI - BUT if in malignant rhythm, okay to shock if she can
   get midazolam. No breathing tube or chest compressions (see OMR note
   [**3-17**] by PCP [**Doctor Last Name **] for full discussion).
     Ms [**Known patient lastname 14235**] has been very clear on multiple occasions that she feels
   so uncomfortable in recent months she accepts mortality if this happens
   naturally. She wishes to pass away at home rather than in a hospital or
   nursing home and to be comfortable at that time. She has had aversion
   to "hospice care" and even rehab in the past though states she wishes
   to be comfortable and is tired of being so uncomfortable. She is aware
   she has severe cardiopulmonary disease. Unfortunately she lives in pain
   as she has been unable to tolerate multiple pain medications.
   - is DNR/DNI (compressions/intubation/cardiopulmonary support not
   appropriate)
   - palliative care c/s
