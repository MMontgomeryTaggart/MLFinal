Chief Complaint:
Transfer for evaluation of sinus bradycardia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 year old lady with a past medical history
significant for erythromelalgia, OSA and hypothyroid who was
transferred from [**Location (un) 240**] for evaluation of sinus bradycardia in
the setting of pneumonia and zoster infection.
.
Briefly, she presented to the OSH on two days ago with symptoms
of worsening generalized weakness, daytime somnolence,
imbalance, poor PO intake and decreased UOP. She had been
diagnosed with herpes zoster ten days prior in the right groin
and was started on acyclovir. On admission, her presenting
symptoms of fatigue were felt to be most likely secondary to
acyclovir and pneumonia.  She has baseline dysphagia and CXR was
concerning for right lower lobe infiltrate.  She was started on
ceftrixone, azithromycin and flagyl. Antibiotic coverage was
narrowed to ceftriaxone alone when a sputum culture grew out
gram positive rods. Interestingly she was noted to be
hypothermic (temperature of 92 rectally), hypoglycemic (glucose
55) and lethargic. Thyroid function tests were normal (TSH 0.94,
free T4 of 1.69). Cortisol, lactate and CPK were normal. The
patient also presented with acute kidney injury felt to be
pre-renal in the setting of poor PO intake (Creatinine 1.5,
Baseline 0.8).  She was treated with D51/2W for hydration and
correction of mild hypernatremia. For management of her zoster
pain, she was started on gabapentin, vicodin and ativan.
.
On HD2 at 8AM, while the patient was asleep, cardiac monitoring
revealed she was bradycardic to the 30s with systolic blood
pressure in the 70s. She was awoken given a NS bolus with
improvement of her vital signs. Later in the day, she was again
bradycardic to the 30s with accomagning hypotension. She was
started on dopamine at 2 mcg/kg/min.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
consulted. An echo demonstrated preserved global systolic
function with moderate MR and mild to moderate TR. Given her
underlying pancytopenia, an SPEP and UPEP were sent to evaluate
for amyloidosis associated arrythmia.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 52**] was
initiated given concern that the patient's lethargy represented
symptomatic bradycardia and thus indicated formal evaluation for
pacemaker placement.
.
Vitals on tranfer were 135-140/67-92, RR 18, HR SR 54-67, Sat
94-97% on 4L NC

Micro:
[**2-8**] blood culture pending
[**2-8**] urine culture negative
[**2-6**] urine legionella negative
[**2-6**] urine culture negative
[**2-6**] blood culture pending

Imaging:
[**3444-2-8**] video swallow aspirating to thin liquids, mildly worse
than baseline

[**3444-2-6**] portable CXR: Right IJ catheter tip is in the cavoatrial
junction. Cardiac size is normal. Bibasilar opacities right
greater than left are a combination of pleural effusions and
atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Of note,
the patient's chin obscures the apices of the lungs.

[**3444-2-6**] [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The left
atrial volume is normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets
consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Normal left ventricular cavity size with mildly thickened
anteroseptal segment of left ventricle (given anteroseptal to
inferolateral wall thickness ratio of only 1.3 does not meet
criterion for asymmetric septal hypertrophy). Preserved global
and regional biventricular systolic function. Elevated left
ventricular filling pressures. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

[**3444-2-5**] [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: 1. Limited study
demonstrating non-specific thickening of the wall of the cecum
that may reflect colitis.
2. Bibasilar pulmonary consolidation consistent with known
pneumonia.
3. Small pleural effusions.  4. Cholelithiasis  5. Compression
deformity multiple verterbal bodies of uncertain age.  6. Tiny
right middle lobe pulmonary nodule. Comparison with previous
studies or follow up with repeat CT is recommended if this
patient is at high risk for pulmonary neoplasm.

[**3444-2-3**] [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] CHEST XRAY: PA and lateral chest compared
to [**3438-4-19**]: 1. Lung volumes are much lower exaggerating any
mild abnormality, particularly at the lung base where there
could be mild interstitial
abnormality or even evidence of aspiration.  I doubt pneumonia
and
there is no mediastinal or pulmonary vascular engorgement to
suggest
cardiac decompensation.  Tiny pleural effusions could be
present. Heart size is top normal and there is no good evidence
for central lymph node enlarged.  2. Lateral view clearly shows
new moderate compression of at least one mid thoracic vertebral
body.

[**3444-2-3**] [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:  There is
normal 2D [**Doctor Last Name 8**] scale appearance of the liver without evidence of
diffuse disease or focal lesion.  No intrahepatic bile duct
dilation.  Extrahepatic bile ducts are within normal limits at 5
mm.  The gallbladder is normal in appearance without stones,
sludge, wall thickening, or pericholecystic fluid.  There is no
hydronephrosis within the right kidney.  No other abnormality
seen in the right kidney, though the assessment was limited.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old lady with a past medical history significant for
erythromelalgia, OSA, chronic dysphagia and hypothyroidism who
was transferred from [**Location (un) 240**] for evaluation of sinus bradycardia
in the setting of pneumonia and zoster infection.

# SINUS BRADYCARDIA: Most likely etiology sinus bradycardia in
this particular patient is underlying OSA, hypothermia
exacerbated by administration of vicodin / gabapentin.  Review
of medication list prior to transfer reveals two medicinal
culprits for bradycardia; both gabapentin and vicodin. Review of
EKGs reveal sinus bradycardia with normal intervals. While she
has a history of hyothyoid, TFTs wnl at OSH confirmed on
admission. No evidence of hyperkalmia, or active ischemia on
history or laboratory tests, cardiac enzymes flat and echo not
consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In this elderly
patient, sick sinus syndrome possible, however more often
associated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter. There
is no indication for pacemaker.  Pacer pads were placed and
atropine at bedside overnight.  Dopamine was weaned off within
several hours of admission with heart rates stable in the 50s to
70s and systolic blood pressures above 90.  Heart rates were
stable in the 60's prior to discharge.

# HYPOTHERMIA: Etiology of hypothermia with rectal temperature
to 92 at OSH unclear. Endocrine disorders including
hypo-pituitarism, hypoaldrenalism and hypothyroidism all may
present with hypothermia and concerning for pan hypo-pit in
setting of hypotension, malaise, relative hypoglycemia, and
bradycardia.  Initial TFTs and AM cortisol level at OSH
appropriate. Random cortisol level on transfer here (23.4)
reflects appropriate stress response. Hypothermia may be
secondary to pneumonia, no indication of sepsis or bacteremia.
Etiology of hypothermia also includes impaired central
thermoregulation w/ ddx including CNS trauma, tumor, empty sella
or drug toxicity. Syphillis negative recently. She was continued
on a bair hugger and coagulation studies were monitored.  If
there is a mental status change at rehab, please consider head
imaging for an intracranial process.

# HYPOTHYROID: Symptoms of lethargy, depression, bradycardia,
and hypothermia concerning for hypothyroid, however thyroid
function tests at OSH demonstrated normal thyroid function which
was confirmed here. She was continued on IV dosing of home
levothyroxine.

# HERPES ZOSTER: The patient presented 2 days after completing
10 days of acyclovir therapy for treatment of herpes zoster out
break in the L1/T12 dermatomal distribution.  She is status post
ten days of 800mg 5xday per day. Physical exam consistent with
late infection, absence of appearance of crusted vesicles
reassuring for immunocompentant host.  She was started on a
lidocaine patch for this issue.

# PNEUMONIA: Right lower lobe infiltrated noted on CXR and CT
chest prior to transfer.  Baseline history of dysphagia
concerning for aspiration pneumonia given geography of
infiltrate.  She was initially started on azithromycin,
ceftriaxone and flagyl for broad spectrum coverage narrowed to
ceftriaxone for sputum cx positive for gram positive rods.
Sputum culture on following morning positive for respiratory
flora and [**Female First Name (un) **]. She was covered for community acquired
pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin and flagyl
for a total of seven days.

# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Resolved. The patient presented to the
outside hospital with acute kidney injury likely pre-renal, she
was also hypernatremic and hyperchloremic. She was treated with
IV fluids (D51/2W) with resolution of her renal function.

# OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA: History of OSA seen in neurology
sleep clinic in the past.  She has declined diagnostic sleep
study and reports not tolerating CPAP in the past. No evidence
of pulmonary hypertension on recent echo.  She does report
daytime somnolence, AM headaches and unrestful sleep on history.
Observed apnea on admission with associated desaturations on
admission.

# DYSPHAGIA: History of dysphagia. Esophagram from [**3436**] revealed
small Zenkers diverticulum however no significant dysmotility.
She was kept NPO at OSH for dysphagia awaiting speech and
swallow evaluation given concern for aspiration pneumonia.
Multiple speech and swallow evaluations documented in past with
variable recommendations. Video swallow revealed aspiration to
thin liquids.  Her diet was advanced to nectar thick liquids and
ground solids.  She is to follow up with speech and swallow at
rehab.

# NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA: Iron studies at OSH consistent with low
normal iron and TIBC and normal ferritin. Hematocrit at baseline
on admission in low 30s. Anemia dates back at least ten years.

# ERYTHROMELAGIA: Rare neurovascular peripheral pain disorder
characterized by episodic microvascular thrombosis often seen as
a complication of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name 1116**]. Often associated with
thrombocytopenia and responsive to aspirin therapy.  Attacks
exacerbated by stress, heat, exertion and insomnia. Unclear
diagnosis, seen by neurology and endocrine here at the [**Hospital1 52**]
with concern for patient self-diagnosis. Ongoing work-up for
possible related rheumatologic manifestations thus far negative.

# DEPRESSION: She was tried briefly on celexa for managment of
coping with new diagnosis and anxiety several years ago.  Seen
by psychiatry in the past.

# RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN: Resolved. Reported right upper
quadrant pain at OSH evaluated by RUQ ultrasound and CT abdomen
revealing cholelithiasis and non specific thickening of cecum.
Abdominal sx resolved and benign exam.

# CORONARIES:  No history of coronary artery disease or evidence
of ischemic disease on most recent echo.

# PUMP:  No history of cardiomyopathy. Echo performed prior to
admission from outside hospital revealed preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function with elevated left
ventricular filling pressures moderate MR and mild to moderate
TR.

# Code Status: The patient was confirmed full code during this
admission.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay here at
[**Hospital1 52**].

You were admitted for fatigue.  It was discovered that you have
a pneumonia, likely because you swallowed food into your lungs.
This is known as an aspiration event, and is a result of your
poor swallowing function.  Your swallow reflex was evaluated and
your diet was change to nectar thick liquids and ground solids
in order to prevent further aspirations.  You were treated with
antibiotics for your pneumonia.

You also have low body temperatures.  This does not appear to be
related to infection.  It is likely that your body's thermostat
is reset to a different average temperature.

The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
START lidocaine patch as needed for right abdominal pain
START metronidazole for one more day
START colace, senna, bisacodyl for constipation
START chloraseptic for sore throat

Followup Instructions:
Please see your primary care physician within one week of
leaving the hospital.

Please follow up with the speech and swallow team at rehab.
