Date of Birth:   [**3314-8-30**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease and stable angina
times 15 years with no previous myocardial infarction history
who on [**3371-1-11**] was walking around home and began noting
crushing substernal chest pressure, unrelenting, non
responsive to sublingual Nitroglycerin.  The pain was
radiating to her back, jaw and left upper extremity.  Due to
the persistence and severity of the pain, the patient called
911 and was brought by EMS to [**Hospital1 7981**]Hospital where
she underwent cardiac catheterization that showed disease in
her left anterior ascending as well as the posterior
descending arteries.  The remainder of the catheterization
data was unavailable due to the emergent nature of the
patient's presentation.  She was brought from [**Hospital1 7982**]Hospital to the [**Hospital1 170**] where
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1077**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6137**] brought the patient to the
operating room and she underwent a three vessel coronary
artery bypass graft including a saphenous vein graft to the
left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal and then saphenous vein graft to the right posterior
descending artery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, angina times 15 years, vertebral fracture,
cardiovascular accident in [**3354**] leaving mild speech deficit
as well as a thyroid nodule.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which causes nausea, vomiting and
flushing as well as an IV dye with an otherwise unclear
reaction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does have also a 25+ pack year smoking
history.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Postoperatively the patient was maintained
on Atropine, Milrinone and Propofol and brought to the
cardiac critical care unit.  Her postoperative course was
noted for transfusion of four units of packed red cells, two
units of platelets and two units of FFP.  She was
cardiovascularly stable.  On postoperative day #1 she was
still on an intra-aortic balloon pump and was therefore
weaned off of this.  Additionally she was weaned to
extubation.  Once this was completed, the patient was
supported neurologically as well as cardiovascularly.  Her
hematocrit was 27 postoperatively and this is post
transfusion.  Immediate postoperative hematocrits were 23 and
the 27 hematocrit was on the a.m. the first day status post
surgery.  Her coagulation panel was normal.  Her electrolytes
were within normal limits with BUN and creatinine of 9 and
.6.  She had a serum lactate of 2.5 and a calcium of 1.11.
She was given appropriate volume resuscitation.  Her Swan
Ganz catheter was left in place for 24 hours postoperatively
to manage her fluid status.  By postoperative day #2 the
patient had been transfused another two units of packed
cells.  The balloon pump placed preoperatively was removed.
She remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  Her
hematocrit was 25.0 down from 28.  Additionally her
coagulation profile and electrolytes were within normal
limits with the exception of a magnesium of 1.3 and ionized
calcium of 1.04 which were repleted.  Serum lactate was down
to 1.1.  Her Swan was removed.  She was started on low dose
Lopressor, Lasix, Aspirin on postoperative day #2.  She
additionally had JP drains and chest tubes that were in
place.  The JP were removed.  She was ultimately transferred
to the floor and started on a cardiac diet.  By postoperative
day #3 the patient continued to be stable.  Her chest tubes
were ultimately removed on postoperative day #3.  She worked
aggressively with physical therapy as well as the nursing
staff to get adequate pulmonary toilet.  She was tolerating a
full diet and she had voided on her own after her Foley had
been removed.  On postoperative day #2 her pain was
adequately controlled on Percocet.  By postoperative day #4
she was ambulating without assistance at a level IV,
approximately 400 feet as well as having adequate pain
control.  Her exam on discharge was noted for a temperature
of 99.2, pulse 84 and regular and sinus, 108/72 blood
pressure, 18 for respiratory rate with 94% on two liters
saturation.  Her exam is notable for a stable sternum, no
drainage.  Her staples were in place.  Her heart was regular,
there was no murmur present.  Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender,
non distended with bowel sounds, no masses or bruit.  Her
lower extremities were warm and well perfused.  No evidence
of edema.  She had palpable pulses, DP and PT bilaterally.
Her discharge labs were remarkable for a CBC of 9,000 white
count, 29 hematocrit and stable, 156,000 platelet count.  Her
chemistries were sodium 144, 3.5 for potassium which was
repleted, 105 for serum chloride, 33 for bicarb, BUN and
creatinine of 11 and .6 respectively as well as serum glucose
of 80.  Her ionized calcium was 1.07, magnesium 1.8 which
were also subsequently repleted.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 25 mg po bid, Lasix 20 mg
po q day, Colace 100 mg po bid, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Aspirin
