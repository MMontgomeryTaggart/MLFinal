   Imaging: [**3-30**] CXR Linear atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region is
   unchanged since the  previous study one day prior. No newly developed
   areas of consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
   Assessment and Plan
   55F TBM s/p Y-stent and hx of COPD p/w acute onset of barking cough,
   treated for anaphylaxis / stridor at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 17**] for
   further management.
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: Unclear what the trigger of this event
   is, could be URI, allergy (but no skin findings), pneumonia given
   possible consolidation seen on cxr (although this may have been soft
   tissue shadowing), migration of Y stent (unlikely given normal bronch),
   vocal cord dysfunction (given deepening voice, but ruled out by ENT
   laryngoscopy), diastolic CHF exacerbation (given evidence of LVH on old
   ECHO, edema), bronchospasm [**1-29**] to mucomyst nebs.
   - Albuterol Ipratropium nebs ATC
   - Tessalon and guaifenesin for cough
   - Consider benadryl and steroids if evidence of stridor
   - Continue home fexofenadine
   - Hold mucomyst nebs for now
   - IP with bronch that did not show evidence of stent migration or
   occlusion; f/u IP recs
   - ENT eval with no evidence of PVCM, only minimal posterior cricoid
   edema; double dose PPI [**Hospital1 **] per ent recs
   - BIPAP at night and during day PRN for SOB (will try to control nausea
   first to make BIPAP more tolerable)
   - Await S&S study (likely Monday)
   .
   # UTI: Urine culture from ED growing > 100k E. Coli now with
   sensitivities complete (sensitive to ciprofloxacin). Patient has been
   afebrile and without flank pain so pyelonephritis is not suspected.
   Repeat U/A on [**2965-3-29**] showed 19 WBCs consistent with UTI.
   - continue patient on Ciprofloxacin 400mg PO BID with 3 day course
   planned, day 1 = [**3-29**]
   # N/V/loose stools. Resolved since stopped codeine (also had two loose
   BMs after feeling constipated all day, so may have been partly due to
   abdominal fullness); will continue to monitor.
   - Continue zofran, compazine prn
   - if patient spikes fever or if abdominal distension worsens, would
   obtain CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast.
   - C diff sent
   # Htn: Continue home amlodipine, metoprolol and clonidine.
   .
   # GERD: GERD may be contributing to symptoms, will increase Prilosec to
   40mg PO BID per ENT recs.
   .
   # LE Edema: Continue home lasix. (LOS balance -1.2 L)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, advance diet as tolerated
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripheral X1
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: ICU for morning, possible call out to floor pending
   further improvement and no increased need for BIPAP
