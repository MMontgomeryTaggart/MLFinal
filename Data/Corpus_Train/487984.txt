Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**3022-3-16**]:
   - Dental recs: Take out partial dentures permanently until mouth heals,
   or use only with meals if needed. Continue Orabase paste for mouth
   pain. Consider Peridex (sp?) mouth rinse if lesions develop
   (antimicrobial).
   - Called out to floor, got a bed, but rejected by floor team based on
   perceived nursing concern over SBPs in 60s-70s (patient was low to this
   range post-HD). So back in unit.
   - Tachycardic to 110s-120s post-HD, came down with 250 cc bolus of IVF

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**3-14**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responeded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3427**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 23**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14131**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   or restart loperamide
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
