   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo M h/o dCHF (EF>55%), AS s/p AVR, AF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
   3rd-degree heart block s/p ppm, transferred from [**Hospital 11433**] Hospital for
   consideration of vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension in the
   setting of severe diastolic biventricular heart failure.
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with
   symptoms of predominantly right-sided heart failure with peripheral
   edema, hepatic congestion, poor appetite, and elevated JVP. Weight was
   significantly elevated from dry weight of 151 lbs. Of note, there has
   been a recent worsening in tricuspid regurgitation that may be
   contributing to the patient's symptoms. Per Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 985**], patient
   may need a degree of peripheral edema in order to have enough preload
   to maintain cardiac output.  So far the patient has had moderate urine
   output with PO torsemide.  He is intermittently unable to take PO
   medications
   - continue diuresis with daily doses of lasix given unable to take PO
   intermittently, recommend another 80mg IV ONCE
   - monitor Is/Os for goal 1-1.5 negative
   - defer right and left heart cath with trial of vasodilator for Monday
   pending improvement in mental status
   - continue metoprolol
   - will need to eventually restart ACE I again, but holding while
   undergoing diuresis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Etiology unclear at this point.  Treating for
   infection, although ICU delirium, worsening CHF, uremia, or
   accumulation of medications in setting of decreased renal function
   could be contributing.  Hypercarbia ruled out with ABG. Consider
   cerebral hypoperfusion. EEG recommended by neurology to r/o seizures
   and was negative.  Patient had 8%  bands on Differential which was
   concerning for infection so is being treated fro HAP.  Mental status
   slightly improved overnight.
   - avoid sedating medications
   - f/u UA, UCx
   - f/u blood cultures
   -Continue empiric tx for HAP (Day 1 = [**4-13**]) with vanc, cefipime, will
   add fluoroquinolone if clinically worsens
   - contact neurology about CHF encephalopathy and possibility of
   therapeutic LP to drain CSF
   .
   # Infection: Patient was recently treated for presumed PNA at OSH with
   cefepime and linezolid .  Was not initially placed on antibiotics here
   given no white count or fever.  However, differential showed bandemia
   which is concerning for infection and patient has trended on the
   hypothermic side.  Most likely source at this time is pneumonia given
   cough, although this could also be explained by CHF exacerbation.  Pt
   unable to produce sputum.
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - try to obtain sputum if possible
   - continue vanc, cefipime for now  (Day 1 = [**4-13**])
   - trend WBCs, fever curve, monitor clinically
   - add expectorant to help produce sputum
   - tessalon pearls
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Improved. The patient is actually at his
   recent baseline creatinine (1.6-1.9). Urine sediment bland. Likely
   etiology is poor forward flow.
   - optimize hemodynamics
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # COPD: The patient sounds rhonchorous and wheezy on exam.
   - standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - inhaled fluticasone
   .
   # Mediastinal adenopathy: Unclear etiology, could relate to infection
   vs. inflammatory or neoplastic process.  Would be helpful to have
   radiology review images in comparison to priors, as patient has
   multiple prior CTs.
   .
   # s/p mechanical aortic valve: Well-seated on recent echo.
   - hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure
   - continue heparin gtt
   .
   # AFib with single-chamber PPM placed for 3rd degree AV block:
   -          hold coumadin for now in anticipation of possible procedure.
   -           on hep gtt
   .
   # h/o CAD s/p CABG: Not on aspirin, presumably because of concern for
   bleeding while on coumadin. No evidence of ischemia. Cardiac enzymes
   negative at Wincester
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   # DM:  controlled by diet
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # BPH:  continue flomax
