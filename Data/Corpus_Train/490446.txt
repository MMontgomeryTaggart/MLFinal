   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with metastatic colon cancer C33D8 5-FU/Leucovorin
   presenting with fever, hypotension and blood per enterocutaneous
   fistula.
   .
   # Hypotension: SBP to 80s in ED and on arrival to ICU after 2 units of
   NS. Pt is mentating well, strong peripheral pulses, voiding. DDx
   includes hypovolemia vs. sepsis. Hypovolemia is a possiblity given poor
   po intake (on TPN), ?blood loss from fistula site (less likely). Sepsis
   also possible - fever, elevated WBC in an immunocompromised host (see
   below).
   - IVF for MAP goal >60
   - Levophed if needed to maintain above
   - Foley for close output monitoring
   - Broad spectrum abx for now Vanco/Zosyn
   - f/u bcx, ucx, sputum, and stool for C.diff.
   - CXR - repeat in am, consider thoracentesis
   - Planned CT abd/pelvis in am
   - serial HCTs, transfuse for HCT < 21 or increased bleeding.
   .
   # Fever, leukocytosis: Potential sources include lines (PICC, port)
   though neither look infected, pulmonary (increased effusions on CXR),
   abdominal - fistula site vs. abscess vs. C. dif.
   - Broad spectrum abx for now Vanco/Zosyn
   - f/u bcx, ucx, sputum, and stool for C.diff.
   - CXR - repeat in am
   - Planned CT abd/pelvis in am
   .
   # Bloody fistula drainage: Surgery consult tonight, serial hematocrits
   - q4hr. Ostomy/wound care consult for fistula site. NPO Hold heparin,
   pneumoboots.
   .
   # Metastatic colon cancer: now followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1814**] (heme/onc) and
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Plan is for staging CT abd/pelvis tomorrow if she is able
   to gauge response to chemotherapy.
   .
   # H/O PE/SVC syndrome/port-related clots: Fondaparinux on hold due to
   recent bleeding.
   .
   # Wound: ostomy consult. Continue topical therapies and local care.
   .
   # DM - Not on meds at home.
   - insulin s/s
