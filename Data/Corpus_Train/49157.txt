Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2063**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left heart catheterization with percutaneous coronary
intervention

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61 year old female with a past medical history
of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with
substernal chest pain for three days. She was in her normal
state of health until Saturday when she developed sudden onset
[**7-20**] substernal chest pressure - "like someone was sitting on my
chest." She initially attributed this to her upper respiratory
tract illness. The pain did not radiate, was not pleurtic, and
was associated with diaphoresis and some shortness of breath.
She went to bed for the rest of the day and all of Sunday. She
woke up Monday morning and the pain was still present. She went
to an oncology appointment (s/p resection of lung nodule several
months ago) where she relayed the above history, so she was sent
to urgent care for evaluation. EKG there reportedly showed 1.5mm
STE III, 1mm STE AVF. She was given one aspirin and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 52**].
.
Of note, pt notes intermittent chest pain with activity for past
six months. She an had abnormal stress test in [**9-/2501**] with
small to moderate intensity perfusion defect in the basal and
mid inferolateral and lateral wall with complete reversibility.
This was managed medically.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were 104/54 HR:77, RR: 15, 100%O2
on 2LNC . Labs notable for a WBC count of 17, creatinine of 1.0,
and troponin of 0.9. EKG notable for 1mm ST elevation in lead
III. She was started on heparin and was taken to the cardiac
catheterization lab.  Access was right radial, she was found to
have mid RCA 100% occlusion that underwent POBA as well as LCX
with focal 70% OM1 stenosis.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2501-11-28**] LEFT HEART CATH (prelim) 1. Selective coronary
angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated two
vessel disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had less than 30%
lumen irregularities. The LCX had a focal 70% OM1 stenosis, and
a difuse 80% stenosis OM2. The RCa had 100% occlusion of mid RCA
with contrast staining.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressures at the central aortic level 102/52 mmHg.
3. Successful aspiration thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty of
the RCA
(see PTCA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the RCA.

[**2501-11-28**] CXR Heart size is enlarged. Mediastinum is
unremarkable. Bilateral perihilar interstitial opacities are
most likely consistent with pulmonary edema.  Underlying
infectious process might be obscured, in particular in the right
lower lung. Evaluation of the patient after diuresis is
recommended.
No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Small amount of pleural
effusion cannot be excluded.

[**2501-11-29**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
basal inferior hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. No echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular
involvement with the recent infarction. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 61 year old female with [**Location (un) **] risk factors
of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use
presenting with several day of chest pain found to have late
presentation ST elevation inferior myocardial infarction with
100% mid RCA occlusion now s/p balloon angioplasty
.
#INFERIOR STEMI: Late presentation of inferolateral STEMI
(elevations in III>II), found to have two vessel CAD on
catheterization with culprit thought to be mid RCA lesion, with
successful recanalization using balloon PTCA. She has remained
chest pain free since the cath. She was started on medical
management with aspirin, prasugrel, heparin x24hours,
atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril.
.
#DIABETES: A1c is 6.3%, suggesting good control prior to
admission.  On 50-56 units of Lantus qAM at home as well as
metformin.  AM FS was 142 today, treated with ISS during
hospitalization.
.
#HYPERTENSION:  Systolic BP remains in the 90-100s since
admission, is currently on metoprolol and lisinopril. Also on
amlodipine and hctz as an outpatient, but this was held at time
of d/c as the patient's BP was consistently 90-100 systolic.
.
#HYPERLIPIDEMIA: LDL 91, HDL 46, TG 377 in [**10/2501**] in Atrius
records.  On simvastatin 80mg daily at home, this was changed to
atorvastatin 80mg. She may benefit from better dietary control
or fibrate for TG control as an outpatient.

# ISSUES TO ADDRESS AT FOLLOW UP:
-Consider fibrate for improved TG control
-LCX with untreated disease:  focal 70% OM1 stenosis, and a
diffuse 80% stenosis OM2.
# PENDING STUDIES AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: final cardiac cath
report.

Discharge Instructions:
You had chest pain and was found to be having a heart attack.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 52**] and a cardiac catheterization was
performed that showed blockages in 2 arteries. The right
coronary artery was opened with a balloon procedure because it
was felt that this blockage was causing the heart attack. The
second blockage was not treated at this time. You will be
started on medicines to help keep the blockages open and help
your heart recover from the heart attack. It is very important
that you take these medicines every day and see your new
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. An echocardiogram was done that showed
your heart function is nearly normal and your heart vavles are
working well.
.
We made the following changes to your medicines:
1. START taking prasugrel to keep the blockage that was treated
open and prevent more clots in your heart arteries. Do not stop
taking this medicine until Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] tells you it is OK.
2. INCREASE your aspirin to 325 mg daily for now to work with
the prasugrel
3. STOP taking simvastatin, take atrovastatin (Lipitor) instead
to lower your cholesterol.
4. DECREASE your lisinopril to 10 mg daily for now as your blood
pressures have been a bit lower during your hospital stay.
5. STOP Hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine for now as your blood
pressure have been somewhat low
