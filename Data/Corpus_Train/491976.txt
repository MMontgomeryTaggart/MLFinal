TITLE: Cardiology fellow CCU admit note
   S: Pt seen and discussed with housestaff. Please see their note for
   complete details. In brief, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 2922**] is a [**Age over 90 304**] yoM w/ reported h/o CAD
   (although dobutamine-MIBI in [**3004**] normal), ? CHF (last EF>55% w/o
   diastolic dysfunction on doppler in [**3007**]), OSA, 2nd degree AVB s/p dual
   chamber [**Company 2322**] PPM in [**3006**], recurrent pna and bronchitis, htn, h/o
   DVT and AF on coumadin here with increased respiratory distress from
   nursing home. Reportedly hypoxic and tachypneic at nursing home with
   rales and elevated JVP on exam. Given 80 mg and then 160 mg of lasix
   (unclear if made urine). EMS called and placed on BiPAP. DNR/DNI
   confirmed from nursing home paperwork.
   O: 98.2, 129/77, 90, 20, 100% BiPAP
   elderly, appears fatigued. Minimally interactive. Attempts to respond
   to verbal stimuli but difficult to understand through BiPAP
   JVP difficult to appreciate with BiPAP mask in place but appears to be
   to earlobe sitting upright
   Irreg irreg. No appreciable murmurs
   Prominent BS on BiPAP. No clear rales or rhonchi
   Distended abd. S/NT.
   No edema. WWP. Full distal pulses
   Labs reviewed. No leukocytosis. Hct normal. Cr 1.9 (last 1.4 [**8-1**]
   here). Bicarb 42 (chronically elevated). CEs negative. INR 2.8. CXR
   suggestive of CHF with possible RLL consolidation. ECG appears to be
   sinus with APCs and V paced rhythm. No RWs in lateral precordial leads.
   No prior paced ECGs for comparison. Last TTE  [**3007**] with EF>55%, mild
   LVH, no e/o diastolic dys, dilated RV with HK, and nl PASP.
   A/P: [**Age over 90 304**] yoM w/ ?CAD, preserved EF, OSA, ? COPD, 2nd degree heart block
   s/p PPM, OSA, DVT/AF on coumadin here with respiratory distress and
   CHF. Unclear cause of CHF given prior normal EF w/o e/o diastolic
   dysfunction. Does have LVH although not tachy, hypertensive, or
   obviously ischemic to cause dCHF exacerbation. Possibility of missed MI
   now causing sCHF given lack of RWs laterally. Per nursing home reports,
   BL O2 88% on 2L so likely acute exacerbation complicating chronic
   underlying lung disease.
   - diurese with lasix IV. Can use gtt prn
   - add metolazone prn
   - cont BiPAP support and wean as tolerated
   - check VBG to evaluate pH and CO2
   - TTE in am
   - if mental status fails to improve, will need to check CT head (per
   nursing home reports, was interactive and appropriate just prior to
   transfer)
   - will need to address goals of care with family in am
   Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
