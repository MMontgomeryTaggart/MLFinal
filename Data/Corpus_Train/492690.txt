   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE)
   Patient is a  83 y/o M w PAF, CAD s/p CABG/PCI and chronic C. diff
   infection who p/w hypotension, a. fib with RVR, and leukocytosis c/w
   sepsis initially thought to be c.diff related, now with GNR
s growing.
   Also has continued risk troponins with ? cardiac component.
   .
   #. Sepsis: volume resuscitated with 3.5LNS since admission with BPs
   stable in low 100s systolic,mentating well and good UOP. Although
   lactate is rising.
   Continue zosyn IV, f/u s/s. Broaden if deteriorates.
   Surveillance blood cultures.
   Trend lactate
   Maintenance fluids.
   - Continue suppression dose vanc (? Set of 3 c.diff)
   f/u O and P, fecal leukococytes, stool cx.
   .
   # Rythm : hx paroxysmal afib. Presented with afib, hemodynamically
   unstable. Now slow afib, borderline tachycardia, although
   HR slows to 50's in sleep. Rate has been in 80s to 90s
   Hold home lopressor for now.
   CHADS score 2 with prior anticoagulation with warfarin however hx
   hemoperitoneum.
   Continue ASA 81
   -continue telemetry.
   .
   #. Coronaries : CAD s/p CABG in [**2558**] with LIMA to LAD which is totally
   occluded after D1,  SVG-D1 (stent in graft), SVG-OM (chronically
   occluded), with most recent PCI in [**6-2**] with stenting Lcx, s/p hip
   replacement. EKG shows Afib with aberrancy, question slow VT s/p
   cardioversion.  Also troponins continue to elevate although CK-MB
   peaked. Etiology troponin leak is
    hypotension [**3-2**] sepsis and Afib, demand ischemia in the setting of
   fixed coronary lesions.
   etting of Afib with demand ischemia likely underlying coronary
   component. Also has elevated LFTs with AST >ALT suggesting non liver
   source, may be hypotension, cardiac related.
   -Increase ASA to 325.
   -am EKG
   -HCT (baseline(25-30).
   Anemia: Chronic normocytic anemia (MCV 92).near or above baseline, has
   a history of chronic anemia of unknown origin requiring multiple
   transfusions, no active issues. HCT stable currently.
   Consider transfusing for HCT <25 or if HD unstable, symptomatic.
   -type and cross.
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCT checks.
   -guiac all stools
   .
   # Diarrhea: Patient has a history of C. diff infection x 5 years. On
   treatment dose vanco p.o and IV flagyl.
   Cdiff x 1 negative, GNRs in blood most likely from GI translocation.
   LFTs not consistent with biliary source with AP wnl.
   Continue zosyn, broaden if necessary.
   f/u O and P, leukocytes
   KUB this am
   Abdominal CT with p.o contrast.
   .
   # Gap Acidosis: Lactate worsened. Continue IVF, abx.
   Trend lactate.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, resume diet until after abdominal CT.
   Glycemic Control:  none
   Lines: PIVs x 2.
