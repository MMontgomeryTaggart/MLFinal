   CHIEF COMPLAINT:indigestion
   .
   .
   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  75 M male with hx IDDM, HTN with 2 days
   nausea,GERD like symptoms, lack of appetite presented to ER today.On
   the night prior to admission he noted anterior chest discomfort very
   similar to prior episodes of heartburn  and had emesis x1 with mild
   improvement with drinking gingerale. He denied any diaphoresis,
   weakness, light headedness, CP or SOB at the time. Of note he has had a
   left thumb infection s/p nail removal and was started on bactrim and
   clinda on Friday.
   .
    Initially in triage his pulse with 57 with sinus bradycardia. On
   repeat vitals his pulse was in the 30s and found to be in CHB on ECG.
   Patient became diaphoretic and nauseous and had drop in BP from 130
   systolic to 100s. He was externally paced and cardiolofy was called. On
   labs was found to have renal failure and hyperkalemia. Given K+
   treatment with insulin, D50, calcium, and bicarbonate. No kayexalate
   was given. ECG with no concerning signs of ischemia. EP placed a
   transvenous pacer wire and being paced at 70. NPO at midnight for
   possible intervention.
   .
   In the ED, initial vitals were HR 60 BP 138/62 afebrile 100% RA RR:16
   HR 36 feeling more fatigued. Repeat EKG at this point showed complete
   heart block HR dropped to 20 with 60/49 more symptomatic, nauseated
   diaphoretic, cards called. EP came, loaded pacer wire 9pm.
   Noted to have K of 7.9 Got ins, D5, switched fluids to D5. No
   kayexelate given.
   .
   Patient with known diabetes, HTN had never been to a hospital before.
   unclear how often he sees doctors. Patient also received Zofran and
   fentanyl and feeling much better after pacing at 70 as well.
   .
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
   he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional
   buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
   negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea
   on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
   .
   On arrival to the floor patient noted to be in 1st degree heart block
   on EKG. Kayexalate was administered given hyperkalemia in ED.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75 y/o male with hx DM, HTN admitted with
   nausea,indigestion found on EKG to have 3rd degree h/b s/p transvenous
   pacing. Pt now in 1st degree hb. Heart block likely [**2-24**] hyperkalemia in
   setting new bactrim use in conjunction with chronic lisinopril with
   subsequent aldosterone inhibition/hyperkalemia. DD includes ischemia
   although EKG/CE not consistent,cardiomyopathy, no hx AV nodal agents,
   increased vagal tone,hyperhypothyroidism although no symptoms
   consistent with this.

   # heart block: Transcutaneous pacer in place set below 60 however pt at
   own intrinsic rhythm currently in 70s
   Floor EKG shows PR prolongation, 1st degree AV block. Rapid improvement
   with treatment hyperkalemia suggests this is etiology

   ------ Protected Section ------
   EP staff [**Location (un) 888**]
   Agree with H+P and A+P of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9338**].
   Pt is a 75yo male with poorly controlled DM2 and CRI (bl crt 1.5) who
   presented with one-two days of nausea and decreased PO intake.  In ER,
   initial rhythm was sinus brady at 50
s with intact AV conduction and
   narrow QRS (iRBB) who then developed CHB with junctional escape in the
   30
s.  The sinus rate is about 60bpm.  Ca was administered and and a
   temp pacing wire was placed via the right IJ. Shortly thereafter, he is
   noted to conduct 1:1 in sinus at 86 bpm with PR about 210ms.  All night
   in the CCU he has remained in sinus with intact AV conduction and no
   need for V pacing.  Labs signif for acute on chronic renal failure with
   hyperkalemia.
   Of note, he has had problems with [**Name2 (NI) 13661**] s/p nail debridment of
   left thumb and MRI demonstrating findings consistent with
   osteomyelitis.
   No additions to make on physical exam
   A/P: Not clear the mechanism of the heart block, but appears possibly
   at the level of the AV node  given that he was conducting 1:1 at a
   higher sinus rate shortly after temp wire.  In addition, if he does
   have osteomyelitis of the thumb, then it would be risky to put in a
   pacemaker at this time.
   1-       ID consult to help with possible osteomyelitis
   2-       Plan for EP study tomorrow to evaluate AV conduction and gain
   insight into mechanism of AV block.
   3-       If needs a pacemaker, will need to discuss with ID the risk of
   pacer infection.  [**Month (only) 47**] potentially get a screw-in temp wire for now and
   defer permanent implant for later on.
