   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o M with PMHx significant for systolic HF (EF 20-25%), MI in '[**31**],
   paroxysmal AV block, atrial fibrillation, h/o v.tach and v.fib s/p ICD
   implantation, who presented to the ED with a chief complaint of
   dyspnea, initially thought to be due to CHF exacerbation but now
   suspicious for pneumonia.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Overnight, the patient had recurrent of dyspnea. Repeat CXR
   showed a more clear left-sided infiltrate. Also, of note, pt had fevers
   overnight. This presentation now more consistent with pneumonia, with a
   possible superimposed CHF component. Pt given
   vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin yesterday evening.
   - vanc/cefepime/azithromycin for broad coverage for pneumonia
   -
   - holding on further antibiotics at this time, as pt does not
   clinically appear to have a pneumonia
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 mg daily
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt has a history of an anterior wall MI in [**2531**]. Pt
   denies any current chest pain, and the first set of CE's was negative.
   Of note, the patient did report some chest pressure last night and in
   the ED this morning, but this has since resolved.
   - will continue to rule out MI with 3 sets of CE's
   - continue to monitor for any chest pain
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt with a history of a.fib, for which he is on coumadin. His
   INR is currently therapeutic at 2.3. Telemetry currently showing
   v-paced rhythm.
   - continue coumadin, with goal INR of 2.3
   - need to closely monitor INR, as it may change at patient received
   levofloxacin in the ED
   .
   # Hypertension: Normotensive at this time.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate
   - lasix bolus PRN
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with a history of anemia, baseline Hct of approx. 33-35.
   Pt currently near his baseline.
   - continue iron supplementation
   - continue to trend hct
   - bowel regimen with colace/senna
   .
   # ID: Per o/p ID notes, the patient is on chornic cefpodoxime for
   ongoing suppression after high-grade viridans streptococcal bacteremia
   in the setting of pacer/defibrillator wires and to continue intended
   life-long suppression for suspected Klebsiella pneumoniae lead
   endocarditis during a prior bacteremia.
   - continue cefpodoxime
   .
   # S/p Whipple:
   - continue pancreatic enzyme repletion
