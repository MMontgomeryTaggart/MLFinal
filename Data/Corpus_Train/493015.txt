   Studies:
   Renal Ultrasound ([**2-11**]): prelim--no evidence of hydronephrosis
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 49 year old F with hx of CAD, DM, HTN presented
   with left lower extremity pain and erythma secondary to acute charcot
   foot with overlying cellulitis admitted to MICU with hypotension and
   oliguria, found to have 4/4 bottles positive for GPCs later speciated
   as MSSA.
   # Hypotension and oliguria--secondary to MSSA bacteremia with SIRS-like
   picture. Patient remained on dopamine yesterday which was d/ce'ed last
   night with appropriate BP range (MAP >65). UOP overnight 45-60cc/hour
   and adequate. Received 4L NS boluses since yesterday AM
   - Continue aggressive volume resuscitation, monitor MAP closely, goal
   UOP 50cc/hr.
   - Treat bacteremia as below
   - Consider ECHO tomorrow if hypotension does not respond to fluids for
   work-up of cardiogenic shock
   # Bacteremia: MSSA + 4/4 bottles. Most likely source is skin infection.
   No murmur on exam to suggest endocarditis.
   - On zosyn (vanc held yesterday in setting of elevated vanc level and
   renal failure). [**Month (only) 56**] transition to nafcillin today.
   - Check vancomycin level this AM
   - Order ECHO to eval for vegatations
   - Order Picc line
   - Continue to check daily surveillance cultures, follow
   # Ischemic ATN--Creatinine 3.7 <-- 3.6. CK 81, Renal ultrasound
   preliminary read negative for hydronephrosis
   - Contine [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose medications (vancomycin)
   - F/u final read of renal ultrasound
   - Continue aggressive volume support as above
   - Holding home [**Last Name (un) 223**], lasix
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   # Left leg acute charcot foot: Differential acute charcot foot versus
   osteomyelitis. Vascular and podiatry following. Podiatry unconcerned
   with osteomyelitis at this time and feel acute charcot foot.
   - Leg elevation and non-weight bearing.
   - Dry stale dressing with ACE wraps and betadine paint to blister, per
   podiatry recs
   - Antibiotic management as above
   - Follow daily blood cultures
   - Continued glycemic  control
   - Follow-up any new podiatry/vascular recs
   - Pain control tylenol and oxycodone
   - [**Month (only) 56**] require PT when more stable.
   # Right upper weakness: Developed abruptly overnight on [**2-10**] and awoke
   her from sleep. MRI negative for acute stroke or septic emoboli. No
   other focal neurological deficits. Neuro believes upper
   brachial plexus/nerve root lesion (C5-C8) with clinical improvement.
   - Check thiamine level today
   - When stable, will get PT/OT consult
   - Defer any further imaging unless clinical condition worsens
   - Appreciate continued neuro recs.
   #Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia
   - NS volume resuscitation as above
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes to ensure not correcting Na too rapidly
   #DM: Finger stick range yesterday 169, 197, 136; adequately controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   -Increase sliding scale or consider insulin drip if poorly controlled
   #Hypertension: BPs have been low in setting of SIRS-like picture.
   -holding [**Last Name (un) 223**], Lasix, metoprolol
   #CAD: No complaints of chest pain or SOB, no concerning EKG changes on
   admission EKG.
   -Continue ASA, plavix and statin
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Dyslipidemia: Atorvastatin 80 mg PO/NG HS
   # CHF: Last ECHO EF >55% on [**3194-4-7**]. No clinical signs of acute CHF on
   exam or by history.
   - Hold Imdur, Lasix in setting of hypotension.
   - Monitor respiratory status closely with aggressive fluid
   resuscitation
   - TTE tomorrow
   # Anemia: Currently at baseline 31. Hemoconcentration on admission.
   - Trend
   - Active T&S
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, diabetic diet
   - F/u ionized Ca (Calcium low at 7.1 yesterday PM)
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals x 2, radial arterial line, order PICC line for
   long term IV ABx
   # Code: Full Code
   # Communication: Patient and family
   # Dispo: to floor if maintained stable UOP and blood pressures.
