Chief Complaint:  Hypotension
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   54 yom ESRD --> home nocturnal PD, CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy  was in
   his USOH until 3-4 days PTA when he developed persistent cough and
   scant white sputum production.  On AM of admission, noted BP systolic=
   80 mmHg (self monitors) associated with presyncope
 transported to
   [**Hospital1 52**] ER.
   Denies dyspnea, chest discomfort, palpitations.  Denies worsening
   exercise tolerance or baseline orthopnea, although notes increased
   bilateral leg swelling.
   [**Hospital1 52**] evaluation revealed BP= 60/44
 121/101 on repeat.  HR= 72, RR=
   19, SaO2= 90% RA in triage, T= 98.3.  Appeared ill.  Blood tests
   revealed elevated toponin.  Received left IJ central line, 1.5 L NS,
   norepinephrine, dexamethasone, Vanco and Zosyn empirically.  ECG with
   new q-waves in II, III, AVF.  Bedside cardiac echo demonstrated global
   hypokinesis.  Cardiology consultation suggested recent MI, but no
   evidence ACS
 ASA & plavix (no heparin).  Transferrred to MICU service
   for further evaluation and management.
   Upon transfer to MICU, stated to feel much improved.  Vasopressor
   weaned to d/c.

   Assessment and Plan
   HYPOTENSION
 multifactorial, with concerns including sepsis,
   hypovolemia (related to dialysis), adrenal insufficiency (chronic
   prednisone with low random cortisol) and cardiac component (likely
   recent MI).  No evidence GI bleed, pulmonary embolism, CVA.  Good
   response to current management.  Continue iv fluids, vasopressor as
   needed, corticosteroids (check cotrosyn stimulation test), empirical
   antimicrobials.  Plan repeat cardiac echo.  Plan continue monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS
 concerns include pneumonia (RLL, cough, sputum), less likely
   cystitis.  No evidence for peritonitis or PD catheter associated
   infection (entry or tunnel infection).  Other concerns include C.
   diff., osteo.  Check stool for C. diff.  Continue empirical
   antimicrobials, targeted to pneumonia.
   NEW ECG ABNORMALITIES
evidence for likely recent MI, without acute
   cornonary syndrome currently.  [**Month (only) 56**] contribute to hypotension due to
   worsening EF.  Plan continue ASA, plavix (no heparin unless CPK rise),
   monitor troponini, repeat cardiac echo, cardiology to f/u.
   FLUIDS
 net hypovolemia.  Continue net resuscitation.  Montor I/O.
   Monitor BP.
   ESRD
 plan resume usual nocturnal PD, but aim for no net fluid
   removal.  No indication for acute hemodialysis
   ACIDOSIS --  +anion gap likely secondary to sepsis, elevated lactic
   acid and worsening renal failure;  check ABG
   IDDM --  monitor blood glucose, insulin to maintain <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- PO
