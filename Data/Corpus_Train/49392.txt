Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2717-2-19**] - left heart catheterization
[**2717-2-21**] - Placement of intra-aortic balloon pump
[**2717-2-22**] Coronary artery bypass grafting
x3,(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM,SVG-PDA),Left atrial appendage resection,
Mitral valve repair(26mm [**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty ring)

History of Present Illness:
This 64 year old male who has not seen a physician for over 5
years  presented with chest pain that started 2 days prior (
[**6-19**]) , lasted for "several hours" and resolved spontaneously.
This was associated with mild dyspnea. He denies fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, PND, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope, presyncope, weight change, lower extremity swelling.
His symptoms seemed to be worsened with exertion and relieved by
rest. ECG in the ED was consistent with recent an inferolateral
STEMI with q waves and prominent R waves in V1-3 and was
admitted. A cardiac cath found 3 vessel disease (90% LAD, LCx
was 100% occluded at its origin, RCA with long 70% mid-vessel
stenosis). He was also found to have moderate-to-severe MR noted
on echo and confirmed with his RHC tracings and ventriculogram.
A cardiac surgery consult was requested for evaluation for CABG
and possibly MV repair.

Pertinent Results:

.
- ECHO ([**2717-2-19**])
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricle is not well
seen. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to
distal inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION; Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
consistent with inferior infarction/ischemia. Moderate to severe
mitral regurgitation which is likely due to leaflet tethering.
Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
- Chest radiograph ([**2717-2-18**])
COMPARISON: None.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Chest pain and shortness of breath, assess for
pneumonia.

FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.
Consolidation is noted at the left lung base with associated
effusion concerning for pneumonia. Right lung is clear.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Bony structures intact.


IMPRESSION: Left lower lung pneumonia with associated effusion.

- Carotid Series ([**2717-2-20**])
Study: Carotid Series Complete

Reason: 64 year old man pre/op CABG.

Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On the right there is no plaque seen in the ICA . On
the left there is mild heterogeneous plaque seen in the ICA.

On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 72/25, 68/28, 63/27,
cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 71 cm/sec. ECA peak
systolic velocity is 81 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.0. These
findings are consistent with <40% stenosis.

On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 79/26, 61/20, 69/34,
cm/sec. CCA peak systolic velocity is 84 cm/sec. ECA peak
systolic velocity is 95 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is .94 . These
findings are consistent with no stenosis.

There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
There is antegrade left vertebral artery flow.

Impression: Right ICA no stenosis.
Left ICA <40% stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10444**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 52**] on [**2717-2-18**] for management
of his chest pain and myocardial infarction. Heparin and Plavix
were started. An echocardiogram showed an EF of 45-50% with
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension and inferior and inferiorlateral
hypokinesis. A cardiac catheterization was performed which
showed severe three vessel disease. Given the severity of his
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted. Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10444**]
was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. A dental consult
was obtained for oral clearance for surgery. Plavix was allowed
to washout. After obtaining a panorex film, multiple extractions
were recommended prior to surgery.

On [**2717-2-21**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10444**] developed chest pain. He was returned to
the cardiac catheterization lab where an intara-aortic balloon
pump was placed. His pain resolved. On [**2717-2-22**] he was taken to
the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels, a mitral valve repair and resection
of his left atrial appendage. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. On postoperative day one, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. His balloon pump was
weaned and removed. Pressors and inotropes were slowly weaned
off.


Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward his preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  He had a brief
episode of post-op atrial fibrillation.  He converted to sinus
rhythm with titration of beta blocker.  Anti-coagulation was
started with Coumadin for left atrial thrombus noted on echo.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 6 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to Presentation rehab in [**Location (un) 394**] on
[**3-1**] in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
