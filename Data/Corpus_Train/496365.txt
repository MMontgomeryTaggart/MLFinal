   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 64 M w/ pmh of cirrhosis from NASH, seizure disorder,
   increasing debilitation presents from a nursing home with lethargy,
   admitted to medicine and treated for PNA, now s/p an episode of
   tonic-clonic seizures and intubation for airway protection.
   .
   # Status epilpeticus: Has a 3-year history of intermittent seizures w/o
   obvious cause.  Was on topamax and Zonisamide on admission and keppra
   was just being added today.  Head CT on admission unchanged from prior.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - will change doses based on neuro recs to eventually taper dilantin
   off.  Continue Keppra at 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] day [**12-21**], then increase to 2250mg
   [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow for 2 days.  When increase to that dose of keppra will
   increase topamax to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].  During that time we will decrease
   dilantin.  Also, depending on level of sedation, patient may require
   additional antiseizure meds, and will contact neuro regarding this
   issue.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Witnessed apnea in the setting of continued
   siezures so was intubated for both airway protection and ventilation
   (O2 sats always okay).  Also being treated for a health-care acquired
   PNA.  Blood cx from admission w/ NGTD.
   - Will discontinue antibiotics as no clear source for infection
   - f/u sputum cx
   - will attempt to change to PS
   - Will consider diuresis to improve ventilation, but will check urine
   lytes first, may be limited by blood pressures
   .
   # Stage IV sacral decubitous ulcer: XR of sacral area did not suggest
   osteomyelitis.
   - continue current would care with packing daily
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Most recent echo in [**Month (only) 94**].  Mild
   LVH.  Appears mildly dry by exam/cr/lytes so will bolus IVF and follow
   urine output.
   - hold metoprolol for now as pressures have been lower (SBP 100s
   post-intubation)
   - will attempt to diurese today to get the patient even
   .
   # HTN: Blood pressures well-controlled while in-house on metop 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - hold blood pressure meds for now as above.
   .
   # CAD: stress MIBI in [**2-23**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe perfusion
   defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left ventricular cavity
   size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved systolic function.  No recent
   h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo with improved EF.
   - follow clinically, no recent lipids, not on ASA, statin
   .
   # DM2: BS more elevated over the last day in the 200s.
   - continue current regimen of lantus and humalog and titrate up prn
   .
   # Cirrhosis: [**12-21**] NASH, LFTs/bili/coags have not been elevated.
   Abdominal U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall
   flow. No ascites identified.
   - check an ammonia level given presentation w/ altered mental status
   - lactulose, rifaxamin-suspect this is contributing to loose stool
   .
   # Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or secondary to
   seizure medications.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Hypothyroid: levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes prn, Tube feeds via PEG
   (failed s/s eval while here)
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: PICC placed, will need fem line removed

   # Code: Full (confirmed w/ family)
