Chief Complaint:  fever, cholecystitis
   HPI:
   Mr [**Known patient lastname 1840**] is a 74-year-old male who originally presented to an OSH with
   on [**2776-7-11**] with cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis as well as an
   NSTEMI; he was transferred urgently to [**Hospital1 17**] for an ERCP.  ERCP
   demonstrated gross pus in the stomach and spilling from the papilla; a
   biliary stent was placed. He was treated with Zosyn x 7 days.
   (8/12/008-8/19/08). A cholecystostomy tube was placed percutaneously,
   and elective cholecystectomy was deferred by general surgery until the
   near future. His LFTs trended down throughout his stay.
   .
   The patient was discharged on [**2776-7-22**], and the tube fell out on
   [**2776-7-23**] at [**Hospital3 1841**] facility.  Per the patient and his
   family, he began feeling ill 1-2 weeks prior to presentation, with
   malaise and intermittant RUQ pain. He was seen at [**Hospital3 1842**] [**Hospital1 **] 5
   days ago; per his family and the surgical note, both an ultrasound and
   CT scan were unrevealing for gallbladder disease. He was treated for
   hypoglycemia and released.
   .
   On the day of admission he developed increasing abdominal pain and
   erratic behavior per his wife. She did not note fevers at home.
   Otherwise, he did not have chest pain, difficulty breathing, increased
   lower extremity edema, vomiting, or diarrhea at home. He did have
   nausea per his wife.
   .
   In the ED:  initial vitals were: T 99.3, HR 86, BP 126/73, RR 20, 95%
   on RA. In the [**Last Name (LF) 68**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] U/S was concerning for acute cholecystitis;
   perforated gallbladder or abscess could not be excluded.  Surgery was
   consulted; it was felt the patient was not a surgical candidate,
   recommended perc drainage and admission to MICU.  Code sepsis was
   called; he was intubated for airway protection (with etomidate and
   rocuronium), a central line was placed for access. He was given
   vancomycin and Zosyn. He was placed on propofol. He is admitted to the
   MICU for further management.

   Imaging: CXR: FINDINGS: Portable AP supine chest radiograph is
   obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen with its tip approximately 4.6 cm
   above the carina. An NG tube is seen with its tip in the approximate
   location of the mid esophagus. Advancement is recommended. Midline
   sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted. Heart size is
   enlarged. Mediastinal contour is widened, which may be related to
   patient's rotation. The lungs appear essentially clear bilaterally,
   though low lung volumes limit evaluation. Osseous structures appear
   intact. Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant. IMPRESSION: ET
   tube appropriately positioned. NG tube projects with its tip at the
   level
   of the mid esophagus. Advancement is recommended.
   .
   ABD US: (PRELIM READ) gallbladder distended with mobile sludge and few
   stones, with +[**Doctor Last Name **], consistent with acute cholecystitis. no biliary
   dilation, gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid seen.
   while the echogenic material is assumed to be in a distended and
   irregular shaped gallbladder, perforated gallbladder or abscess cannot
   be excluded since no normal wall is discerned. CT recommended to assess
   for complications of cholecystitis.
   Microbiology: blood cx pending
   urine cx pending
   ECG: sinus tach at 130, RBBB, upsloping st segment depressions leads
   v2-5 (seen on prior)
   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement now represents with acute cholecystitis and
   septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Likely due to biliary source; last admission culture
   only grew LACTOBACILLUS. Urine negative. CXR unrevealing. Ultrasound
   cannot rule out gallbladder perforation and cholecystitis evident on
   scan.
   - a line placed on arrival to ICU
   - further evaluate gallbladder with CT abdomen when more clinically
   stable
   - Broad spectrum abx: Zosyn/vanc
   - may require percutaneous drainage
   - IVF bolus until CVP = [**7-13**]
   - then pressors as required to maintain MAP >65
   - check central venous sat, consider PRBC transfusion as required
   - appreciate surgery recs, will continue to follow
   - follow cultures
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory: intubated for airway protection in the setting of septic
   shock.  CXR w/o acute process in ED. At risk for ARDS given sepsis. ET
   tube in position though 5 cm above carina.
   - titrate invasive ventilation by ABGs
   - daily wakeup
   - VAP bundle
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - propofol for sedation for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr 2.8, but baseline difficult to discern as
   large variation lately. Likely baseline low 2's with current elevation
   [**1-3**] sepsis.
   - continue to trend
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   # anemia: hct low 30s on recent admissions so near baseline
   - iv ppi
   - guaiac stools
   - active t&s
   .
   # DM: Attempt sliding scale insulin though may require insulin gtt
   difficult to control.
   .
   # Gout: no acute issues, complaining of foot pain prior to admission,
   pain control prn
   .
   #CAD s/p CABG; CHF, HTN, BPH:
   -holding asa, statin, ace-i, BB, amlodipine, lasix, prazosin in setting

   #Access: Central line placed in ED, PIV, arterial line
