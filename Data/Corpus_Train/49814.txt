CONTINUATION OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Infectious disease:  On
[**8-8**] the patient was taken to the Operating Room for subtotal
calcanectomy of her left foot.  Tissue cultures were taken at
that time and found to be growing [**Female First Name (un) **] and MRSA sensitive
to Vancomycin.  On [**2669-8-19**] the patient underwent debridement
of her right foot with partial calcanectomy with wound
debridement and culture.  There is no growth from this wound
culture.  Her antibiotic regimen is currently Vancomycin 1
gram intravenous dosed by levels in dialysis and levels less
then 15, Levaquin 250 mg po every 48 hours, Fluconazole 200
mg every 48 hours and Flagyl 500 mg po b.i.d.  The patient is
to complete a six week course of antibiotics, course
beginning on [**2669-8-16**] to be completed on [**2669-9-17**].  The
patient's blood cultures have been negative to date.  Stool
cultures have been negative for C-diff.  Right heel tissue
culture from [**8-19**] shows no growth and left heel tissue culture
showing [**Female First Name (un) **] and MRSA sensitive to Vancomycin.  The
patient has remained afebrile on this antibiotic regimen and
per Podiatry she is nonweight bearing on either foot until
further follow up with podiatry and surgery.

2.  Renal:  End stage renal disease on hemodialysis, access
issues were reviewed and discussed with the renal team.  A
tunneled Perm-A-Cath dialysis catheter was placed in the
right groin on [**8-12**].  No further complications were noted.
Catheter was used successfully in hemodialysis.  Vancomycin
was dosed by levels for levels less then 15 and given through
the dialysis catheter.  The plan is to continue ongoing
evaluation of the left groin for kidney transplant.
Electrolytes and CBC were monitored every other day in
dialysis and currently stable.  The patient is to continue
