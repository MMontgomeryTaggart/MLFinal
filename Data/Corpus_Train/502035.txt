   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo female s/p renal tx X3 (most recent CRT [**9-15**]) and panc X2 (most
   recent [**2-14**]), severe PVD, HTN presents with rigors/fevers and mental
   status changes.
   # Sepsis- Patient presented with fever, tachycardia and hypotension.
   Thus far source of infection unclear; CXR negative, CT abdomen
   unrevealing, U/A negative, Renal Ultrasound unrevealing, Lactate 2.0,
   LFTs unremarkable.  Patient does have history of VRE Peritonitis as
   well as an indwelling tunneled femoral line which is a likely source;
   at this point patient refusing line removal. CT did show maxillary
   sinusitis and pt did have recent complain of a persistant "head cold"
   per her husband. [**Name (NI) **] source could be ostomy site given recent
   purulent drainage although exam at this point unrevealing.
   - Will continue to treat with Imipenem/Vancomycin for broad coverage
   given h/o VRE and immunosuppression (day #1 is [**1-5**])
   - Continue home steroids for now - received stress dose in ED
   - Goal MAP>65
   - F/U Urine culture
   - F/U Blood cultures
   - Follow up final read of CT abdomen, renal transplant ultrasound, CXR
   and CT head
   - Need to address access and removal of line pending culture growth
   - Check vanc trough after 3rd dose (day #1 [**1-5**])
   .
   # Mental Status change- Patient with acute MS changes although events
   not clear at this time. Per her husband, pt has altered MS every time
   her BP drops.  BP was low on EMS arrival. Pt does have labile BPs and
   takes both BB and fludrocortisone prn to manage her pressures. It is
   possible that infection precipitation hypotension causing the MS
   changes. Currently MS improving and appears to be mentating well.
   - CT at this point unrevealing for ICH or edema.
   - Toxic metabolic work up in place as above.
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #Apnea-Unclear if truly apneic; appears to be breathing shallow on exam
   -Monitor for now
   .
   #S/P Kidney/Pancreas Transplant-Pts creatinine slightly above baseline
   on admission; likely prerenal given hypotension/sepsis
   -Continue immunosuppressives Azathioprine, Prednisone, Tacrolimus 3mg
   [**Hospital1 **] (sublingual per transplant; crush meds)
   -Tacrolimus level in AM
   -Transplant Surgery/Medicine following
   .
   #h/o Hypertension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   -Will hold Toprol and Fludrocortisone for now
   .
   #CAD- Holding BB given hypotension, continue aspirin
   .
   # Blindness [**1-12**] DMI: stable, She continued her home drops and may need
   to bring in from home given non-formulary
   - Cyclosporine 0.05% gtts; one in each eye QID
   - Acular 0.5% drops 1 gtt os q3D
   - Loteprednol Etabonate 0.2% drops 1 gtt ou [**Hospital1 **]
