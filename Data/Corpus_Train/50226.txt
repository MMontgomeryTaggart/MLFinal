Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1276**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
81 year-old female with history of CAD (s/p 2V CABG [**2650**]),
Mobitz II Block (s/p PPM), HTN who presented to the ED on [**2659-9-8**]
with complaints of cough and shortness of breath that emerged 1
day prior. Per the pt.'s daughter, she began feeling
progressively orthopneic with difficulty lying flat and having
to sleep sitting up the night before admission. She also
complained of not getting enough air 2-3 days prior to
admission. She'd also had a chronic, non-productive cough
treated with Advair but of unknown etiology. She did not report
fevers, chills, dizziness/lightheadedness, leg swelling, chest
pain or palpitations. In the ED, VS were T 99.6; BP 88/49, RR
30. She received IV fluids and developed respiratory distress
with hypotension, was intubated and transferred to the MICU.
.
Since transfer to the floor, antibiotics were stopped, for it
was felt that her symptoms were more consistent with CHF flare.
She was diuresed well with IV lasix.  TTE was checked on [**2659-9-9**]
what showed EF=35-30% (decrement from prior studies) with
multiple wmas, 3+ MR, 2+ TR.  This was repeated on [**9-14**] (?was
decrement in setting of myocardial suppression, ?sepsis,
stress).  This TTE showed EF=20% with significant dyssynchrony
(with tissue doppler), multiple wma's (including a dyskinetic
apex with akinesis of parts of the anterior wall), 2+ MR.  She
also had her PM interrogated on [**9-13**] (found to be functioning
adequately).  She was transferred to F6 for closer cardiac
monitoring.
.
On presentation, she reported some SOB and general
deconditioning.  She denies a history of LE edema, PND, or
orthopnea.  She denies CP/F/c and is still c/o a cough.

Brief Hospital Course:
81F CAD, HTN, PPM admitted to MICU for hypoxic respiratory
failure and shock of unknown etiology, now thought to be
cardiogenic in nature since an infectious work up was
unrevealing. Pt. transferred to the floor on [**9-11**] and now being
diuresed and further assessed for CHF. The following issues were
investigated during her hospitalization:

Cardiogenic vs. Septic Shock
In the MICU, patient was quickly weaned off pressors and
extubated on [**2659-9-10**]. She was being ruled out for an infectious
etiology of her shock and was empirically started on
Vancomycin/Levofloxacin/Flagyl. CXR, Chest CT and abdominal CT
showed no source of infection and pt. remained afebrile. She had
leukocytosis of 12.6 upon admission to the MICU and blood
cultures were significant for 1/4 bottles of gram positive cocci
in clusters, Coagulase (-). Upon her transfer to the floor, both
Levofloxacin and Flagyl had been discontinued and Vancomycin was
discontinued on the floor since the pt. had no source of
infection and was not thought to be colonized by MRSA since
coagulase was negative. She remained afebrile on the floor and
had no need to be restart antibiotics. A cardiogenic cause of
shock was also pursued and an [**Date Range 942**] done in the MICU revealed an
EF of 30% and focal hypo/akinesis of the apical free wall of the
apical free wall of the right ventricle. Pt. was r/o x 3 for an
MI.  Repeat TTE showed EF to be 20% with apical akinesis.  Given
this new cardiomyopathy, she was taken for cardiac
catheterization which revealed no new critical disease.
SPEP/UPEP/TSH/Fe studies were all within normal limits.  The
most likely etiology for new cardiomyopathy is tachycardia
induced (or secondary to pacing).  She was started on Coreg,
aldactone, losartan.  Amiodarone was substitued for norpace (for
atrial fibrillation).  She was diuresed as possible and will
need repeat TTE in 1 month.  She may need Biventricular pacer in
the future and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].   She was
maintained on her cardiac regimen of ASA, coreg, statin, [**Last Name (un) 89**].

Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure
Per MICU notes and admission radiographs, exact source of
decompensation remains unclear. There was no documented
temperature above 99.8 while in the MICU and only a mild
leukocytosis on admission without bands. In the absence of an
infection and with the low EF and edema on CXR, the likely cause
of the hypoxia was thought to be pulmonary edema. Pt was
transferred to the floor on 4 liters of oxygen with o2
saturation ranging from 94-97% and was agressively diuresed with
Lasix 20 mg IV BID.
A repeat [**Last Name (un) 942**] was done on [**9-14**] and results are as above. The
patient was followed by cardiology and for cardiac optimization
afterload reduction was started with Losartan 25 mg po qd.
Aldactone, Coreg, losartan were continued with diuresis as
possible.

# TRANSAMINITIS
On admission, the patient's LFTs were elevated (AST as high as
140, ALT as high as 170). Once she was transferred to the floor,
they were followed with serial labs and gradually decreased to
AST 47 and ALT 97. Cause of transaminitis was likely passive
congestion/shock and had improved at time of discharge.  She
will require LFT monitoring given Amiodarone therapy.

# HCT DROP: after initial drop, hematocrit remained stable.

#Constipation
Pt. was started on an aggressive bowel regimen to include a
fleet enema which was successful at evacuating her bowels on
[**9-14**]. Continue bowel regimen.

# HTN:  regimen was changed to Coreg, losartan, aldactone with
good control

# HYPERLIPIDEMIA
Pt. was maintained on her outpatient dose of Atorvastatin

# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Resolved, suspect pre-renal azotemia from ? CHF/poor forward
flow.  Creatinine remained stable throughout the remainder of
the hospitalization
