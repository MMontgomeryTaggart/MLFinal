   Cardiac cath: [**3413-12-19**]
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
   OSH blood culture:
 bottles positive for GPC, speciation and
   sensitivities pending
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting evaluation for CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**00**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker, high dose statin
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - started low dose ACEI (captopril 6.25 mg PO TID) on CCU transfer
   given EF of 30%
   - hold heparin gtt for now, will restart when pt has anginal equivalent
   ("heart-burn" sx)
   - plavix washout for 5 days prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US and UA as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   - restart heparin gtt
   - remove swan catheter today
   .
   # PUMP:  Acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 30%
   on TTE on [**3414-12-19**]) likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows
   elevated pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient
   with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures) likely worsened in setting of elevated PCWP. Patient has
   evidence of both right and left sided heart failure. Received 60 mg of
   IV lasix in cath lab, and another dose of 40mg IV lasix, with good UOP.
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L to -1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue ACEI (captopril) given depressed EF
   - continue BB
   - remove swan today
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**12-18**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  This is concerning especially given her smoking
   history.  However, her weight loss and decreased appetite could be due
   to related to heart failure and bowel congestion, especially given her
   elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above to reduce wedge pressure
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - f/u final CTA read
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - pt will need regular outpatient f/u
   - remove swan today
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # SOB: likely secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt
   is ambulatory, no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE
   exam.
   - treat CHF as above
   - f/u on final PE-CT read
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - bloos sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # Positive blood culture from OSH:
 bottles positive for GPC at [**Hospital1 **].  Possible contamination but need to f/u OSH micro.
   - call [**Hospital3 **] today regarding speciation and sensitivity
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   - offered nicotine patch, pt refused
