   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**3418**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   .
   1.  PNA.  Patient has purulent productive cough, leukocytosis and
   radiographic evidence of PNA.  Of note, patient hospitalized
   [**Date range (1) 5332**] for PNA and was treated with 7 day course of levaquin.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - vanco/zosyn/levaquin
   - f/u blood cultures
   - mucinex
   - chest pt
   .
   2. Hypotension.  Sepsis +/- hypovolemia in setting of infection.
   Normal lactate is reassuring.
   - check mixed venous sat to determine volume/cardiogenic vs. septic
   cause
    - on levophed, attempting to wean today
   - IVF boluses for hypotension
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source is pneumonia, however, will
   evaluate for other sources. Recent UTI, s/p 10 day course of irtapenem,
   however, repeat UA appears unremarkable.  PICC line does not appear
   infected and has only been in for two weeks.
   - vanco/zosyn/levaquin for PNA.
   - follow up sputum, urine, blood cultures
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   .
   4.  ARF.  Patient has baseline cr of 0.2.  Cr of 0.4 on admission.
   - follow Cr, uop
   .
   5.  H/o DVT.  IVF in place since [**3418**].  Suspician for PE currently low
   given PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at this
   point.
   - HSQ prophylaxis
   .
   6.  Anemia.  Baseline Hct 30-35.  Most recent anemia studies in [**10-8**]
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend Hct
   .
   7.  Anxiety.
   - klonopin at minimum doses to prevent hypotension
   .
   8.  Chronic pain.
   - methadone, baclofen, lyrica
   .
   9.  Hypothyroidism.
   - levothyroxine
   10.  Depression.
   - Citalopram 40 mg
   11. Constipation
   - Sucralfate 1 gram QID
   - bowel regimen of Polyethylene Glycol 17 grams daily, Docusate Sodium
   100 mg PO BID, Senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   FEN: IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, regular diet

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 54F paraplegia s/p MVA [**3418**] c/b multiple
   episodes of sepsis / resistant UTIs. Admitted yesterday with lethargy,
   hypotension and hypoxemia. RLL infiltrate on CXR, responded to IVF
   overnight via PICC. Refuses alternative access.
   Exam notable for Tm 100.8 BP 100/60 HR 75-115 RR 18 with sat 99 on RA.
   WD woman, NAD. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. Chronic edema. Labs
   notable for WBC 16K, HCT 30, Cr 0.2, lactate 0.8. CXR with RLL
   infiltrate.
   Agree with plan to manage pneumonia c/b likely sepsis with broad
   antibiotic coverage, IVF resuscitation, wean pressors down as able.
   Will check f/u lactate and CVO2, but appears well perfused and only
   mildly hypovolemic at this point. Agree with broad coverage for now,
   will check legionella Ag and d/c levo if negative. She has passed S+S
   evals in the past, but aspiration may be contributing to this
   presentation as well. PICC is a potential primary or secondary source
   for infection, will d/c if BCX are positive or if exam changes. Will
   hold off on echo unless BCx are positive or CVO2 low despite adequate
   fluids. Will continue home meds for neuropatic pain. Supportive care as
   outlined. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
