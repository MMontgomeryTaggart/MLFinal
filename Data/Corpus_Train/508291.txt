   Assessment and Plan
   67M h/o T4 paraplegia, recurrent UTIs [**2-20**] indwelling foley, multiple
   stage 4 decubs was admitted to ICU with fever to 101.8, transient
   hypotension that resolved with IVF but continued on sepsis protocol.
   VS Stable overnight.
   .
   # FEVER - Pt has multiple prior admission with similar presentation,
   recent work up for fever was unrevealing.  Pt is currently being
   presumptively being treated for UTI, culture pending, though UA was
   weakly positive and may be [**2-20**] chronic colonization. Prior urine Cx
   were sensitive to Cipro. Etiology of fever includes PNA although f/u
   CXR was unremarkable & no h/o productive cough. Pt has a h/o chronic
   diarrhea with neg work up to date vs infection of sacral decub
   infections possibly complicated by osteo given his elevated CRP.
   - continue vanc and cipro until recent culture data finalized
   - f/u urine cx, blood cx, CIS
   - f/u stool cultures
   - f/u swab of sacral decubitus ulcers
   - f/u plastic surgery recs, would like to r/o osteo
 felt that
   decubiti did not look infected, no evidence of osteo, well know by
   plastics, did have large work-up in [**11-26**] including tagged WBC scan
   that was negative for osteo
   .
   # HYPOTENSION - Pt has h/o transient hypotension & this episode
   resolved with 3L IVF, pt never required pressors. Most likely due to
   autonomic disregulation [**2-20**] paraplegia, sepsis unlikely given this
   clinical picture.  Will continue infectious work-up, treating UTI with
   empiric Cipro. Diff Dx also includes dehydration [**2-20**] diarrhea, MI ruled
   out with 3 sets of CE. Adrenal insufficiency unlikely given that pt has
   been essentially normotensive, cortisol drawn in ED at 15 did not rule
   this out definitively.
   - will continue to bolus IVF prn, goal MAP>65
   - continue Cipro and Vanc as above, until cx data negative
   .
   # Chest/abd pain - etiology unclear, pt has multiple vague complaints
   and describes chest/abd pain pain which has been present for more than
   3 months. EKGs on admission showed not acute ST-T wavce changes. Trop
   mildly elevated but stable at 0.08, CK & CKMBs flat. Abd mildly
   distended/tympanic but NTTP/NABS, CT abdomen unremarkable.  PT denies
   pain this am.
   - will check EKGs prn CP, althought unlikely cardiac in nature
   - LFTs WNL, follow serial abd exams
   - f/u stool cultures as above
   .
   # CAD - Pt s/p 2v CABG with EF 25-30%, normal valves.  Pt appeared
   mildly volume overloaded on admission, but home regimen does not
   include ACE/Lasix, possibly due to BP lability & autonomic dysfunctn
   -continue home regimen of aspirin, simvastatin.
   -consider restarting ACE, BB, spirinolactone, lasix as outpt
   .
   # Multiple Decubitus ulcer - Stage 4 decubs that probe to bone, beefy
   red granulation tissue, except 1 right lateral lesion with yellow/black
   coverage that may benefit from debridement
   - consulted plastics
 felt that wounds had healthy granulation tissue
   and saw no evidence of infection and did not feel that there was osteo
   - kinair mattress
   - wet to dry dressings [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/u wound swabs, likely to be contaminated with colonizers
   .
   # anemia - baseline 30-33, now 28.5, will follow for now.
   - guaiac stools x 3.
   .
   # h/o PE - s/p IVC filter, INR elevated this am at 3.5.
   - hold coumadin tonight, repeat INR in am
   .
   # Asthma - continue home advair, added albuterol prn.
   .
   # Depression - continue citalopram.
   .
   # h/o back pain (chronic)- continue home regimen of baclofen, tramadol,
   and neurontin.
   .
   # h/o cholelithiasis - continue ursodiol.
   .
   # vitiligo - not on treatment currently.
