HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old male
with a past medical history of coronary artery disease,
status post CABG in [**2563**] and hypercholesterolemia who was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 519**] Service on [**2578-4-10**].  The patient
initially presented to [**Hospital1 413**] with a three week history of
intermittent band-like chest pain radiating down both arms
with some associated numbness and tingling in his fingertips
bilaterally.  The patient also complained of associated
fatigue, and mild shortness of breath.  The patient claimed
that each episode of pain lasted approximately three to four
minutes.  The patient additionally complained of
approximately a weeks history of nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea, which he attributed to a "flu-like illness".  The
EKG at the outside hospital reportedly demonstrated T wave
depression in leads V1 through V3 and ST depression in leads
V2 and V3.  The patient's CK was negative but he did
demonstrate elevated troponin to 1.2.  Transthoracic
echocardiogram conducted at the outside hospital reportedly
demonstrated an inferior wall reversible defect and the
patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital6 117**] on [**2578-4-10**] for further
evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG in [**2563**] with
anastomoses from the LIMA to the LAD and RSVG to the OM and
PDA.
3.  Rectal prolapse.
4.  Nasal polyps.
5.  Status post pelvic fracture in [**2556**].
6.  Chronic lower back pain and arthritis.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Cardizem.
2.  Aspirin.
3.  Lopid.
4.  Lipitor.
5.  K-Dur.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes anaphylactic shock.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives mainly in [**Country 2933**] with his
girlfriend but has a home in [**Name (NI) 3178**], [**State 2663**] and is
here for approximately two months of the year.  The patient
has a four pack year history of smoking but is currently
abstinent.  The patient consumes occasional alcohol.  There
is no history of IV drug use but does reportedly smoke
marijuana as an adjunct to his low back pain therapy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 519**]
Service on [**2578-4-10**] under the direction of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Cardiac catheterization conducted on [**2578-4-10**] demonstrated
three vessel coronary artery disease with complete occlusion
of the saphenous vein graft to the PDA.  In addition, the
saphenous vein graft to the OM1 was diffusely diseased.  As
well, the LAD was noted to have a 95% stenosis just after D1
and mild diffuse disease in its proximal segment.  The
patient's ejection fraction was noted to be 52%. The patient
was treated medically with beta blockers and aspirin for
hospital days number one and two, after which point, a
prolonged discussion was held with the patient regarding
surgical options.

Following a discussion of the relative risks and benefits of
cardiac surgery, the patient agreed to a coronary artery
bypass graft to be scheduled on [**2578-4-13**].

On [**2578-4-13**], the patient underwent a re-do coronary artery
bypass graft.  Anastomoses included SVG to LAD, SVG to PDA,
and SVG to OM.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with
a bypass time of 85 minutes and a crossclamp time of 57
minutes.  The patient's pericardium was left open; lines
placed included an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter;
both ventricular and atrial wires were placed; mediastinal
and bilateral pleural tubes were placed.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated, for further evaluation and
management.  On transfer, the patient's mean arterial
pressure was 78, CVP 11, PAD 20, and his [**Doctor First Name **] was 27.  The
patient was noted to be in normal sinus rhythm with a heart
rate of 85 beats per minute.  On transfer, active drips
included Neo-Synephrine and propofol.  In the hour shortly
following his arrival in the CSRU, the patient was noted to
have a hypotensive episode which was responsive to additional
Neo-Synephrine and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

The patient's postoperative hematocrit was noted to be 25.4.
On postoperative day number one, the patient was successfully
weaned and extubated in the CSRU.  He was subsequently
advanced to p.o. intake, which he tolerated well, and
tolerated removal of his chest tubes and Foley catheter well.
The patient was subsequently noted to be independently
productive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of
his stay.

On the evening of postoperative day number two, the patient
was cleared for transfer to the floor and was subsequently
admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service under the direction of
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  Postoperatively, the patient had an
uneventful clinical course.  The patient was evaluated by
physical therapy, who deemed him an acceptable candidate for
discharge home following a course of acute medical treatment.
The patient's epicardial wires were successfully removed
without complication and he was noted to remain in sinus
rhythm for the duration of his stay.  The patient was
advanced to a full regular diet, which he tolerated well, and
was noted to have adequate pain control via oral pain
medications.

By postoperative day number five, the patient was noted to be
independently ambulatory with good oxygen saturations on room
air.  His dressing was noted to be clean, dry, and intact,
and his sternal incision was noted to be intact with
Steri-Strips neatly in place.  No evidence of erythema or
purulence was noted in any of his surgical regions.  The
patient was subsequently cleared for discharge to home with
instructions for follow-up on postoperative day number five,
[**2578-4-18**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
home with instructions for follow-up.

STATUS AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. 12 hours times ten days.
2.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q. 12 hours times ten
days.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Percocet 5/325 mg one to two tablets p.o. q. four to six
hours p.r.n. pain.
6.  Lipitor 60 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient has been instructed to
maintain his incisions clean and dry at all times.  The
patient may shower but should pat dry incisions afterwards.
No bathing or swimming until further notice.  The patient is
to resume a cardiac diet.  The patient is to limit physical
exercise; no heavy exertion.  No driving while taking
prescription pain medications.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his primary care
provider within one to two weeks following discharge.  The
patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] four weeks
following discharge.  The patient is to call to schedule an
appointment.
