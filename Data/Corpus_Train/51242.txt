PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a well-developed, well-nourished
white male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs are stable.
He is afebrile.  HEENT exam:  Normocephalic, atraumatic,
extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx benign.  Neck
supple with a full range of motion, no thyromegaly.  He had
bilateral lymphadenopathy.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
and percussion.  Cardiovascular examination revealed regular
rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 with no rubs, murmurs or
gallops.  Abdomen was soft, nontender with positive bowel
sounds and no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are
without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  The pulses were 2-plus
and equal bilaterally throughout with the exception of the
right femoral popliteal PT and DT which were all 1plus.  His
neural exam was nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**3425-9-14**] he underwent cardiac
catheterization, which revealed normal left main and 95
percent proximal left anterior descending lesion, 70 percent
mid left circumflex lesion and the RCA was a small,
nondominant vessel with no disease.  His ejection fraction
was 65 percent.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1077**] was consulted.  On [**3425-9-15**]
the patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two
with three LIMA to the left anterior descending and reverse
saphenous vein graft to the OM.  The crossclamp time was 55
minutes.  Total bypass time 76 minutes.  He was on
nitroglycerine and propofol and was taken from the Operating
Room to the Catheterization Lab as he had poor doppler
signals in his graft.  Catheterization revealed the LIMA had
spasm and he also had spasm of the OM.  He had a Cypher stent
placed in the left anterior descending and another Cypher
stent placed in the left circumflex.  He was then transferred
to the CSIU on nitroglycerine and propofol in stable
condition.

He was extubated on his postoperative night.  He did have
some atrial fibrillation.  He had an echocardiogram on
postoperative day number one, which showed that the left
atrium was mildly dilated.  There was mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy.  Ejection fraction was 55 percent.
He also received a unit of blood that day for a hematocrit of
26.  He continued to progress and postoperative day two had
his chest tubes discontinued.  Postoperative day three his
wires were discontinued and he was ready for the floor, but
there was no bed. On postoperative day four his hematocrit
was 23.3 and he got a unit of blood and was transferred to
the floor.  He continued to progress and on postoperative day
five he was discharged to home in stable condition.

LABS ON DISCHARGE:  His labs on discharge were hematocrit
25.8, white count 7.3, platelets 209, sodium 142, potassium
