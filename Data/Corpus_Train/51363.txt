Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and plan: 56 yo M w/ cirrhosis p/w hematemesis and
BRBPR, initial HCT of 15, now s/p 4u of pRBCs and 1u FFP.
.
# GI bleed: Patient initially had dark stools and BRBPR.  He
also had hematemesis (2 episodes on [**Month/Day (2) 133**] but non since).  He
was severely anemic on presentation with a HCT of 15 which
increased to 25 with 4 units pRBCs.  He was given FFP as well
for a concern of coagulopathy.  The patient has a history of
alcoholic cirrhosis as well, with know grade 1 esophageal
varices in the past.  He was started on octreatide gtt and
protonix gtt.  He was given a total of 5 units of pRBCs in the
ICU, with a stable HCT at the time of discharge from the MICU.
The patient underwent EGD which showed no active bleeding
source, but there was evidence of an ulcer which was thought to
be likely the source of his GIB.  His h.pylori was checked and
was pending on day of d/c.  An abdominal US was performed which
showed Similar heterogeneous echogenic appearance of the liver,
with somewhat increased ascites. No focal mass identified on
somewhat limited evaluation. He had an episode of melena on [**6-8**]
but this resolved and his Hct only decreased to 25 then
rebounded to 27 and then to 30 on morning of d/c, this was
repeated and it was 27.6, thought that the 30 represented lab
error as pt. had normal stool in between the two draws. Diet was
advanced per liver to full w/ salt restriction on day of d/c and
pt. tolerated it well.


# pneumomediastinum: initially, the patient was thought to have
a pneumomediastinum.  Thoracic surgery was consulted, and he was
started on empiric fluc/zosyn.  A CT neck was performed, which
did not show any evidence of pneumomediastinum, and the
antibiotics were stopped.  He was only continued on
ciprofloxacin since he is a cirrhotic patient with UGIB.

# cirrhosis: D/c'd on aldactone.
.
# htn: resumed moexipril on D/C
.
# hyperlipidemia: REsumed statin on d/c
.
# code status: presumed full
