CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 58 year old man who
presented with shortness of breath since four days prior to
admission.  This is a gentleman with type 1 diabetes
mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease
and a family history of coronary artery disease who reported
increasing shortness of breath since the [**11-1**] with
a gain of approximately three pounds and increasing lower
extremity edema over that week as well as complaints of
orthopnea.  The patient only sleeps on one pillow and during
this period increased to requiring two or more pillows.  The
patient had been on p.o. Lasix of 80 p.o. twice a day.  The
patient's primary care physician instructed him to increase
the Lasix to 80 mg p.o. three times a day but still received
no benefit from the increased dose.

He had increasing shortness of breath and presented to [**Hospital3 11385**] on Friday, the [**11-4**] where he was
intubated for respiratory distress and also found to have by
report from [**Hospital3 **] a non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction with troponin of 2.2 and a peak CK of 135 and a
peak MB of 4.6.  The patient had been treated with Lasix drip
and Solu-Medrol and switched to intravenous Niseratide and
Nitroglycerin.

The patient also was found to be in acute renal failure with
a creatinine of 4.4; his baseline was 2.4 in [**3164-4-19**].
The patient had an arteriovenous fistula placed on the [**5-8**] and hemodialyzed about 3 kilograms of fluid and
also was given two units of packed red blood cells because of
an initial hematocrit of 24%.  The patient was extubated on
the [**5-9**] and then transferred here at the family's
request.

On the day of admission, he was short of breath only with
exertion, had no lower extremity edema, but did note a dry
cough.  He had no complaint of chest pain, back pain, nausea
or vomiting.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was only pertinent for
chronic low back pain.  He denied fevers, nausea, vomiting.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   He is married to [**Doctor Last Name 2020**]; 23 pack years of
tobacco; quit ten years ago.  Social ETOH.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Notable for coronary artery disease and a
brother who had an myocardial infarction at age 40, but no
history of diabetes mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Initial vital signs were temperature
of 99.2 F.; heart rate 67; blood pressure 133/31; respiratory
rate 16; saturation of 94% on three liters nasal cannula.
Weight was 53.2 kilograms.  General appearance was that of a
well appearing man in no apparent distress.  Head was
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Mucous membranes were moist.
Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Neck was supple with no adenopathy.
Jugular venous pressure was approximately 10 centimeters.
There were no bruits on auscultation.  Lungs were notable for
no crackles but there were diffuse bilateral wheezes with
good air movement.  Cardiovascular examination notable for a
normal S1, S2.  There is a III/VI systolic ejection murmur at
the apex.  No S3 or S4.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended, normal bowel sounds are present.  No palpable
organomegaly.  Back had no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Extremities were warm with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
He had palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  There
were coronary artery bypass graft scars on his shins
bilaterally.  No complaints of calf pain.  He had noted
decreased light touch and decreased proprioception
examination of toes and Babinski's were ambiguous
bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  EKG from the outside hospital had normal sinus
rhythm at 65 beats per minute, normal axis, and left
ventricular hypertrophy and flipped Ts in leads I, AVL, V5
and V6.  He also had one movement of ST depressions in leads
II and AVF and one more ST elevations in V1 and V2.

EKG here was also notable for the ST depressions in leads II
and AVF as well as ST elevations in V1 and V2 with also the
addition of [**Street Address(2) 2867**] depressions in V4, V5 and V6.

He had an echocardiogram done in [**3164-7-20**], which
showed an ejection fraction of 60 to 65%, one plus mitral
regurgitation, mild atrial dilatation.  He had a negative
exercise tolerance test in [**3161**].

White blood cell count 13, hematocrit 31, platelets 401.
Chem 7 was notable only for a glucose of 533 and the presence
of large serum acetones.  Anion gap was 17 as the patient was
defined to be in diabetic ketoacidosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Diabetic ketoacidosis likely believed to be secondary to
possible infection, community acquired pneumonia versus
stress myocardial infarction.  The patient was put on an
insulin drop until his fingersticks were below 250, at which
point D5W were added on and the gap was narrowed for adding
on subcutaneous insulin and stopping the insulin drip.

During hospitalization, CKs were normal and flat.  Initial
value 65 and 66; troponin however was borderline positive;
initial value 1.7 and repeat was 1.80.  Sugars remained
elevated and the patient remained on an insulin drip for
several days, however, his gap did narrow with subsequent
anion gap narrowed from 17 to 10.

A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on the
[**8-10**], which showed an ejection fraction of 65% and
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, however, compared to
prior TTE was mild anteroseptal and apical hypokinesis as
well as one to two plus mitral regurgitation which was
worsened in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**3164-4-19**] echocardiogram.

His hematocrit also was low requiring another transfusion of
a unit of packed red blood cells to maintain above 30%.

Renal was also consulted for his renal failure.

The patient also had a chest film performed on the [**5-10**] which was notable for mild congestive heart failure.

The patient underwent a renal ultrasound for his acute renal
failure.  The ultrasound was notable for no hydronephrosis,
no hydroureter. There was, however, diffusely increased
cortical echo texture consistent with chronic interstitial
disease.

The patient was hydrated for the renal failure.  He was
believed to be somewhat partially prerenal given his BUN and
creatinine ratio was greater then 20%.  Given the worsening
of his echocardiogram report, however, despite the negative
CT scans and the borderline positive troponin, the decision
was made to have the patient undergo a nuclear stress test.

The patient underwent a Persantine MIBI on the [**3164-9-14**].  The patient had no symptoms or EKG changes
throughout the study.  Nuclear report was notable for the
following:  Absence of myocardial perfusion defects and the
presence only of a fixed left ventricular mild enlargement.
Ejection fraction was calculated to be 40% with global
hypokinesis.

The patient remained within a normal anion gap and his sugars
dropped back down.  He was transitioned back to his
outpatient subcutaneous Glargine and Humalog insulin sliding
scale.  He was transferred to the Floor.

The patient was discharged to home on the [**3164-9-15**].  The patient was discharged on his original outpatient
medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.
2.  Atorvastatin 10.
3.  Hydralazine 100 q. six hours p.o.
4.  Isosorbide dinitrate 30 p.o. three times a day.
5.  Calcium carbonate 500 four times a day.
6.  Epo-alpha subcutaneously twice a week.
7.  Atenolol 75 p.o. q. day.
8.  Insulin see below.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient was instructed per the advice of Nephrology
not to take any Lasix until his follow-up appointment with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20815**] one week after discharge and to resume his home
insulin regimen.
2.  The patient was also told to call the Cardiology Clinic
for a follow-up appointment the subsequent month at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 20816**].
3.  He was instructed to call the MRI Suite, for outpatient
MRA to rule out renal artery stenosis in the next few weeks.
