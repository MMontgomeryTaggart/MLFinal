   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3232**] is an 83 year-old man with a history of coronary artery
   disease and respiratory failure due to acute-on-chronic systolic CHF.
   1. Acute on chronic systolic CHF plus severe mitral regurgitation:
   - furosemide 80 mg IV bolus followed by 8 mg/hr drip; added Diural
   250mg for goal of net negative 100 cc/hr
   - cont amiodarone for beta blockade
   - Continue ACE, although have low threshold to d/c in case of worsening
   renal function
   - cycle enzymes to rule out acute infarction as cause of decompensation
   - low Na/fluid restricted diet
   - consider transfer to CCU service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4448**] is in agreement
   2. Hypoxemia: likely secondary to pulmonary edema and decompensated
   heart failure; lack of fever, sputum production, leukocytosis, bandemia
   all argue against pneumonia
   - hold further antibiotics for now
   - [**Month (only) 56**] need another ABG today as pt is hypercarbic but appears to be
   compensated
   3. Coronary artery disease:
   - cont home aspirin, clopidogrel, statin
   - cycle enzymes
   4. Atrial fibrillation:
   - cont amiodarone
   - hold warfarin given supratherapeutic INR and possibility of invasive
   procedure; if subtherapeutic, can use IV heparin
   5. Acute on chronic renal failure (baseline CKD IV): likely due to poor
   forward flow from decompensated CHF as above
   - urine lytes, urine eo
s- pending
   - diuresis as above
   6. DM2: on oral agents at home
   - sliding scale insulin
   7. Anxiety:
   - cont home citalopram; prn low-dose lorazepam
