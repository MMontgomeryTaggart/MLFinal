   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   on heparin ggt
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
   still actively drinking
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 TOBACCO USE, CURRENT
   smokes 1 ppd
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITHOUT ACUTE EXACERBATION
   tight on admission; on standing atrovent nebs with albuterol PRN
 DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, LIPID DISORDER)
   on lipitor79 yo male with man with extensive DVT and PE's but
   hemodynamically stable on 4L NC.
   .
   #. Thromboembolism: unknown cause for such extensive DVT. Concern re:
   recurrence of prostate cancer though PSA 0.1.
   -- No indication for embolectomy, per vascular surgery.
   -- Heparin gtt with goal PTT 80 - 100.  Continue to taper heparin drip.
   -- Continue coumadin 5mg daily
   -- will monitor closely for decreasing BP and tachycardia --> low
   threshold to give IVF for increased preload in setting of PE's
   -- Plan to review OSH images and get previous D/C from Norwoord.
   .
   # Wheezing
 likely due to baseline COPD and PE.
   --Treat with atrovent nebs.
   .
   #. Alcohol History: still heavy drinker
   -- On CIWA with valium
   -- continue folate, MV, thiamine
   # Altered mental status
 patient now at baseline per family.  Concern
   re: chronic wernikie-korsakoff syndrome or acute intoxication that
   resolving.
   .
   #. FEN: low salt diet; urine somewhat concentrated but other labs ok
   and no need for IVF currently as BP/HR stable; will encourage PO
   intake.
   # Eosinophilia
 persists; consider initiating an evaluation
   .
   #. CODE: DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient
