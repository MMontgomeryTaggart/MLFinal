   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o F h/o CAD, CHF, DM, AFib hypertherapeutic on coumadin, and
   chronic c. diff colitis on recently elevated dose of PO vanco a/w
   vomiting and diarrhea with evidence of colitis, and acute on chronic
   renal failure in the setting of escalating diuresis.
   .
   #Acute on chronic renal failure - suspect multifactorial pre-renal
   physiology (poor forward flow from decompensated CHF, uptitrated
   diuretics, vomiting, diarrhea, poor PO intake); unlikely UTI/pyelo as
   U/A more c/w contamination from foley; bland sediment; likely still
   intravascularly volume depleted as low-normal CVP, poor UOP, only
   received 1 L NS so far; dehydration and ARF likely account for
   hyperlactatemia
   -favor giving additional fluid challenge (500 cc bolus) with careful
   consideration to LVEF
   -holding K, [**Last Name (un) 223**], diuretics
   -urine lytes for frac excr. UN
   -refrain from treating urine until culture data available
   .
   #Acute on chronic systolic heart failure - suspect some precipitant
   such as silent ischemia, dietary indiscretion, med changes, excessive
   thyroid replacement, in recent past which tipped patient into volume
   overload, putting her further out on the starling curve, thereby
   worsening renal function and fluid and electrolyte balance
   -favor giving fluid challenge as above over gentle diuresis as entirely
   preload dependent [**2-10**] severe valvular disease
   -cycle CE's to r/o MI
   -CPAP, carvedilol for afterload reduction; may uptitrate B-blocker as
   BP tolerates
   -cont. digoxin
   -repeat TTE
   .
   #Bilat pleural effusion/RLL opacity - likely transudative effusions in
   the setting of decompensated CHF, cannot exclude underlying PNA but low
   suspicion since no fever or leukocytosis; stable resp. status on
   minimal O2 requirement
   -no indictation for ABX for now (esp. in light of h/o c. diff)
   -blood Cx pending
   .
   #N/V/D - suspect viral etiology as has not had vomiting with prior
   episodes of c. diff; no c/o pain, benign abdominal exam, and
   supratherapeutic INR makes ischemia/thrombosis less likely; lactate
   trending down
   -check LFT's, repeat c. diff toxin, stool Cx
   -cont. PO vanco, flagyl not indicated
   -repeat c. diff toxin
   -consider contrast CT if renal function improves
   .
   #Anemia - Hct 32, b/l ~38; no s/sx bleeding but GI tract most likely
   source; has polyps on prior colonoscopies; on Fe replacement for
   chronic anemia, likely element of ACD as well
   -guaiac stools
   -hold off on FeSO4 as may darken stool and be constipating
   -follow Hct, x-fuse for <24%
   .
   #AFib - V-paced
   -holding coumadin with supratherapeutic INR
   .
   #DM -
   -[**1-10**] basal insulin + RISS while NPO, f/b full dose NPH when eating
   .
   #CAD - no ischemic changes on EKG, will ROMI
   -cont. ASA, B-blocker
   -cycle CE's
   -repeat TTE
   .
   #HTN -
   -Cont. carvedilol for HTN, afterload reduction
   -holding diuretics, [**Last Name (un) 223**] in ARF
   .
   #Hypothyroidism
   -Cont. thyroxine
   -TSH, free T4 pending
   .
   #F/E/N
   -500 cc bolus, follow CVP ([**8-19**]) & UOP (>30 cc/hr)
   -monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **] while in ARF or being diuresed, replete cautiously
   -NPO o/n f/b starting diet; consider S&S c/s
   .
   #PPx - PPI, supratherapeutic INR, no need for bowel regimen
   .
   #Access - L IJ, PIV
