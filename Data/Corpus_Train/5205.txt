PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.5 F, blood
pressure 124/52, heart rate 16, respirations 18. In general
the patient was lying in bed, squirming around in no acute
distress.  The patient appeared disheveled. Head and neck
exam - pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Sclerae were anicteric.  Oropharynx clear.  Mucous membranes
were dry.  Cardiac exam - normal S1, S2, regular rate and
rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs - there were
concentric bronchial breath sounds to the lower areas. There
are no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi.  There was good air
exchange. Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologic exam - unable to assess orientation secondary to
language barrier.  The patient appeared alert.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact except for right cranial
nerve VII (asymmetry of right face with smile).  Strength was
[**6-14**] in the left upper extremity, [**5-15**] in the right upper
extremity. Full strength in lower extremities.  There are
brisk bilateral lower extremity reflexes.  Babinski was
positive bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.8, hematocrit
41.4, platelet count 189,000, PT 12.7, PTT 31.4, INR 1.1,
sodium 141, potassium 4.9, BUN 35, creatinine 5.9, glucose
350.

KUB was done showing a nonspecific bowel pattern with no
evidence for obstruction.

Chest x-ray showing no pneumonia or CHF. There is a stable
widened mediastinum.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The initial impression was that the
patient's nausea and vomiting were secondary to
gastroparesis.  The patient had been experiencing similar
symptoms about two years but no work up was done.  The
patient was started on Reglan 10 milligrams IV qid and the
plan was to monitor for symptomatic improvement while
advancing his diet. However on hospital day three the patient
was noted to have asymmetric pupils on physical exam. The
patient became progressively more somnolent throughout the
day with poor blood pressure control ( blood pressure went as
high as in the low 200).

A head CT scan was done showing a left pontomedullary
hemorrhage. The patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure control with a
Labetalol drip.  A repeat head CT scan was done the next day
which showed no interval change. A ct angiogram as well as
MRI/MRA of the head were done to evaluate for arteriovenous
malformation or aneurysm which was negative.

The patient's mental status gradually improved with improved
blood pressure control and the patient was transferred out of
the Intensive Care Unit and to the General Medical Floor. On
the floor adequate antihypertensive controlled with a
.................... regimen of Metoprolol 100 milligrams po
bid, Hydralazine 50 milligrams po qid and Vasotec 10
milligrams q day.

Hospital course was complicated by fever spikes to 102 F.  In
light of a worsening pulmonary exam (dense rales in right
lung), and a questionable right sided infiltrate on chest
x-ray the patient was treated with Zosyn for a nosocomial
pneumonia to finish a two week course.

A swallow evaluation was done which showed silent aspiration
with nectar thick liquids in large boluses.  Therefore the
Speech and Swallow Department suggested honey thick liquids
alternating with pureed solids in small amounts. The patient
appeared to be tolerating this diet well.  A calorie count
was done on the day of discharge which showed that the
patient was only taking 12% of the required calories.  It was
planned for the patient's caloric intake and nutritional
status to be re-evaluated once the patient was to be
transferred to rehabilitation.


DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 7467**].

1.  Aspirin 81 milligrams po q day.

5.  Nephrocaps 1 po q day.
6.  Pravachol 20 milligrams po q day.
7.  NPH 12 units subcutaneous [**Hospital1 **] with regular insulin
sliding scale on transfer to rehabilitation.
