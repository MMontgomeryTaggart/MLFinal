   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress:  Doubt PNA. Picture c/w CHF and cardiac asthma.
   Continue with lasix drip.  consider albuterol/atrovent for wheezing.
   Echo today.
   Afib:  HR currently controlled.  INR high - hold warfarin for today.
   Hypercarbia:  New for him, may be due to contraction alkalosis, but
   will require close monitoring as he may develop respiratory failure.
