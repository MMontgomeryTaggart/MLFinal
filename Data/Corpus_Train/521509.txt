   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 1125**] is a 69F with MMP including chronic ventilator dependence s/p
   trachostomy [**3-/3017**], highly resistant pseudomonal PNA's, COPD on home
   oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic HF, and Type II diabetes
   mellitus.  She presented to the ED today after she was found to be
   hypotensive and febrile at [**Hospital1 77**].
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely sepsis in the setting of fevers, leukocytosis,
   elevated lactate, and a positive UA.  Possible sources include urine
   vs. her recently infected PICC line.  Low suspicion for PNA given clear
   CXR.  She is currently stable after 4L of NS and levophed, with a CVP
   of [**8-7**] and MAPs in the 70s, and lactates trending down.  Looking at
   past culture data, she has had many infections with highly resistant
   organisms, including MRSA and highly resistant pseudomonas.  Last micro
   from urine [**3-/3017**] with pseudomonas resistant to cipro, otherwise
   sensitive.
   -Empiric coverage with vancomycin and cefepime for now to cover for
   line and urosepsis, can peel off vanco if blood cultures negative.
   Dosing vanco by levels
   -Urine and blood cultures pending
   -IVF boluses with goal CVP >12
   -Levophed to keep MAP >65
   -Obtain a mixed venous 02 sat
   -Monitor UOP
   .
   #. ?Distended Abdomen: Some concern for ischemic bowel in the setting
   of elevated lactate and hypotension.  Passing stool and flatus in the
   ED with guaiac negative stools.  Surgery has already evaluated the
   patient, and has low suspicion.
   -Serial abdominal exams
   -Trend lactate
   -F/u surgery recs
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8, 3.4 on
   admission, and has trended down to 2.5 with fluid resuscitation.  Urine
   output has not picked up despite adequate volume resuscitation and CVP
   at goal.  THis raises suspicion for ATN
   -Will send urine lytes and sediment
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis: Initially an anion gap lactic acidosis, now a
   non-gap acidosis likely secondary to normal saline
   -Switch to LR for volume
   .
   #. Chronic vent dependence: Seems to have happened during her last
   admission, where she required a long period of intubation for
   respiratory failure in the setting of PNA.  Currently dysynchronous
   with the ventilator.  Recent ABG 7.29/39/117 on pressure support [**1-5**],
   with spontanous tidal volumes 525.  PIPs and plateaus under 30
   -Monitor serial ABGs and adjust prn
   -Watch PIPs closely as the patient is tachypnic to monitor for auto
   PEEP
   .
   #. COPD
   -continue home albuterol and ipratropim nebs, continue current steroid
   taper
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus
   -ISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure: does not appear volume overloaded
   on exam.
   -Holding home beta blocker and lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #. Hypertension
   -Hold home diltiazem, hydralazine, beta blocker
   .
   #. Seizure disorder
   -continue home oxacarbazine
