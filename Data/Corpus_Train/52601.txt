for the past 5 years to the point that she is literally home
bound. Her activity of daily living is managed by her husband.
She is very short of breath with any physical activity and she
usually just sit in her room and watch TV. According to her son,
he noted SOB with talking long sentences while talking to the
patient on the phone. She also claims that she had been swollen
for almost a month prior to admission. SHe did not seek medical
attention all this while because she believes that there is
nothing that could be done.She denies any history of asthma or

Brief Hospital Course:
1. hypercarbic respiratory failure
In ICU, the initial thought process was COPD exacerbation given
hypercarbia, no infiltrate on CXR, and evidence of emphysema on
CXR. She was treated with steroid taper/solumedrol, albuterol,
atrovent and swithced to po prednisone prior transfer to floor.
She also had a CTA which was negative for PE. On the floor, she
was continued on nebulizers and eventually MDI and she
demonstrated appropriate usage of MDI upon discharge. She
declined pulm rehab but was willing to have PT at home. Smoking
cessation was addressed on multiple occasions & pt did well on
NRT throughout her stay.

4.anasarca
Her initial workup included LENI which was negative for deep
veous thrombosis.Her albumin was 2.3 initially but this was not
reliable since it is a negative acute phase reactant. The
albumin returned to [**Location 386**] limit when her acute problem s
resolved.
For the anasarca, she also had workup for congestive heart
failure. Echocardiogram in [**3396-9-26**] showed that overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) and right
ventricular systolic function appears borderline depressed.
Concurrently, her liver enzymes showed hepatitis and her
hepatitis serology was negative. Thus this was thought to be
caused by possible right heart failure with hepatic congestion.
Cardiology was consulted. They suggested a possiblity of fluid
overload from the resuscitation fluid that the patient recieved
in ICU. Of note, pt presented originally with anasarca, prior to
volume resuscitation. Right heart catheterization was suggested
if no improvememnt with diuresis. Patient was diurese with goal
of -one liter a day. SHe responded very well with lasix. Her
transaminases decreased and edema improved drastically. She was
kept on CHF diet and lasix, initially IV then switched to po
upon discharge.

4.RLL pulmonary nodule
CT [**3396-9-25**] showed RLL pulmonary nodule likely bronchogenic cyst.
Pulmonary team was curb-sided. Given the size and appearance of
the nodule, this is felt to be unlikely malignant. Repeat CT in
3 month to assess growth given extensive smoking hx.Pt denies
any weight loss.
