ECHO [**2982-12-7**]
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential. Effusion echo dense, c/w blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. No echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. No evidence of constriction.
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a small,
partially echo filled circumferential pericardial effusion most
promient anterior to the apical right ventricle. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade or of constriction.
Compared with the prior post-pericardiocentesis study (images)
reviewed of [**2982-12-6**], the findings are similar.
.
.
ECHO [**2982-12-6**] (TTE)
.PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Conclusions
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2983-12-7**], the pericardial effusion is much smaller and
cardiac tamponade is no longer present.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 YO gentleman with metastatic melanoma presents with SOB, CP
found to have circumferential pericardial effusions and pulsus
of 14.
.
# pericardial effusion - patient was found to have a pulsus of
12 on admission. Chest pain persisted and pulsus went up to 14
overnight. Imaging showed pericardial effusions. Pt underwent
emergent pericardiocentesis on [**2982-12-6**] and 570 ccs were drained.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for possible pericardial window
procedure but it was felt the pt was too high risk and with
severely poor prognosis. Drain put out roughly 1.5 L of bloody
fluid overnight. F/u echo showed no reaccumulation of fluid.
Drain was pulled [**2982-12-7**] as output had trailed off and plan was
for pt to go home with hospice care.
.
#DIC - fibrinogen of 90 on presentation, plts of 63, INR 2.2,
elevated Tbili. FDB 160-320. Fibrinogen went up to 140 overnight
and INR up to 2.9 then down to 2.1 on [**2982-12-7**]. DIC could be [**12-26**]
malignancy itself or [**12-26**] zelboraf use. DIC labs monitored and pt
given 1 unit of FFP along with vitamin K. No evidence of
bleeding other than bloodly fluid from pericardial drain.
.
# Melanoma- patient started on zelboraf recently. The medication
is known to lead to melanoma flair if stopped for prolonged
periods of time if stopped for prolong period of time. zelboraf
was held on admission. Pt with metastatic disease. Zelboraf
serum levels sent to genentech. Palliative care and oncology
were following. Pt requested to go home with palliative care.
Pain controlled with home regimen while in house along with IV
dilaudid. On discharge pt was sent with fentanyl patch, liquid
dilaudid, liquid ativan, and home dose oxycontin and klonipin.
