Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Rheum c/s and recs: Doesn
t believe GI presentation is lupus related,
   only lupus manifestation currently is renal related.
   1. Recommend a GI consult for EGD/colonoscopy for bowel
   visualization and biopsy as needed
   2. Continue infectious work-up including stool studies,
   evaluation for C. diff, and other enteric pathogen
   3. Empiric antibiotic coverage for enteric pathogens
   4. Recommend further evaluation for falling hematocrit and
   platelet, including reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, fibrinogen,
   PF4 antibody, iron studies, B12, folate, stool guaiac
   5. Please check anticardiolipin IgG, anticardiolipin IgM, and
   anti-beta2-glycoprotein.
   6. If possible to perform by reversing heparin, please ask lab to
   perform a lupus anticoagulant assay. (may not be able to correct
   for presence of Coumadin or heparin)
   7. Please check for titers of dsDNA & levels of CH50, C3, and C4
   8. If patient is refusing PO prednisone 4 mg qd, please provide
   equivalent IV dose of Solu-Medrol 4 mg qd to prevent patient from
   developing symptoms related to adrenal insufficiency.
   Surgery recs: Bowel rest, NPO. Occult blood positive (trace) If HCT
   drops, will need NGT lavage.
   Repeat HCT 22.4 from 21.4.
   On Regular diet since refusing PO meds unless has diet.

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo F with ESRD secondary to SLE (started PD approx two weeks ago),
   malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events (on
   warfarin) presented with N/V/D, abd pain, and hypertensive urgency.
   # Nausea/Vomitting/Diarrhea/Abd Pain: Abd pain improved, N/V/D
   resolving, trace positive stool Guaiac. DDx: Infection: c. diff colitis
   or viral gastroenteritis; Ischemia: microthrombosis, malignant HTN, or
   SLE vasculitis (ischemia unlikely given low lactate); and SLE
   enteritis.
   - Appreciate surgery and rheum recs. Will c/s GI to consider
   EGD/colonoscopy to assess for bowel biopsy/visualization
   - Continue supportive care and serial abd exams
   - F/u Stool Studies (Stool cx to date not obtained as no BM yest to
   obtain sample); f/u rheum-SLE studies
   - Continue Flagyl empirically
   - Will continue to follow stool guaiacs
   - Heparin gtt for treatment of possible thrombotic ischemia. Will hold
   warfarin today in case of potential GI procedure.
   - Dilaudid q3hrs for pain management
   # Hypertensive urgency: O/N SBP <150, on PO meds since yesterday.
   Labetalol gtt stopped.
   -          Appreciate renal recs.
   -          Continue labetalol, nifedipine, and clonidine PO. Will start
   aliskerin. Will hold hydralazine for now. SBP goal of <160.
   -          Pain control with Dilaudid
   .
   # ESRD: [**1-12**] SLE.  Estimated GFR is 8mL/min. Cr increased, currently
   stable at 8.0.  Unable to tolerate a full 1L of PDx2 trials.
   -          Will hold PD for today; reconsider PD tomorrow per renal.
   .
   # Anemia:  Previously decreasing HCT; currently HCT stable at 22.4
   (baseline in mid 20s). Etiologies include GI bleed (guaiac pos stool,
   abd pain), hemolysis, and ACD [**1-12**] CRF. T&S on [**9-14**].
   -          Follow HCTs
   -          Per rheum, will check retic, haptoglobin, fibrinogen.
   -          Per renal, consider Epo 2-10,000 units SC today given
   chronic anemia.
   #Hypocalcemia: Ca decreased at 6.4
   -Continue Calcitriol and Calcium carbonate.
   -Will provide Calcium Gluconate 6gm IV x1 now.
   -Follow daily calcium
   #Metabolic Acidosis:  VBG suggests Metabolic Acidosis with respiratory
   compensation. Bicarb continues to remain low at 14, baseline 16-20, AG
   14. Per renal, pt is well known to their service and has received
   NaHCO3 in the past.
   - Per renal, pt will need NaHCO3 to correct acidosis. However, need to
   correct hypocalcemia first.
   .
   #OSA: pt unable to tolerate CPAP.
   -Continue to encourage CPAP at night to help OSA and also HTN.
   -F/u with outside PCP for OSA [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u.
   # H/O Venous Thrombosis: warfarin 2mg qd at home. INR 1.2 on arrival,
   last INR 1.5.
   -          Heparin IV gtt; hold Warfarin today for potential GI
   procedure.
   -          Follow INR with daily coags
   .
   # SLE:  Possible etiology of GI symptoms includes vasculitis.
   -Appreciate Rheum assistance.
   -Cont. prednisone 4mg home dose; Will check prednisone level.
   # Hyponatremia: Na currently at 131; Etiologies include GI losses, CRF.
   -IVF: NS at 5cc/hr
   -Recheck lytes tomorrow.
   # FEN: Change regular to renal diet. IVF as listed above. Replete lytes
   prn.
   .
   # ACCESS: PD cath, PIVx1, mid-line placed.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin gtt, holding bowel regimen
   .
   # CODE: FULL
   .
   # COMMUNICATION: patient, mother [**Name (NI) 4859**] [**Name (NI) **] (works at [**Hospital1 52**]).
