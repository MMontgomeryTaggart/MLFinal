PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, blood pressure was
152/81, pulse was 64.  The patient is approximately 6 feet
tall and weighs about 210 pounds.  In general, he is a well
dressed, well nourished male who is slightly overweight in no
acute distress.  His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination revealed him to be normocephalic, atraumatic,
sclerae were anicteric and his neck was without
lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  His neck was supple and had
full range of motion.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Of note, there was a small scar at the inferior
aspect of his chest which was pink and hypertrophic.  His
cardiac examination revealed him to have a regular rate and
rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His abdomen was
round, soft, nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly.  His gait
was slightly antalgic on the right.  He was able to heel-toe
walk.  He was able to plantar and dorsiflex bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with a diagnosis
of spinal stenosis and underwent an L3-S1 laminectomy and
fusion by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3149-6-27**].  Of note, during the
operation he had profound bleeding with an estimated blood
loss of approximately four liters.  This required transfusion
of eight units of packed red blood cells, four units of fresh
frozen plasma, and one unit of platelets, in addition to five
liters of lactated Ringers.  He made only 350 cc of urine
throughout the entire operation.

Postoperatively he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit due to his coagulopathy.  Additionally he had some
difficulty with his respiratory status, requiring prolonged
intubation.  He was extubated in the Post Anesthesia Care
Unit and failed extubation and reintubation was necessary.
His laboratory studies showed his hematocrit to be 31, PT to
be 13.9, PTT 58.3, and INR 1.3 in the Post Anesthesia Care
Unit.  Thus it was felt that he was in DIC.  His hematocrit
and coags were continued to be followed and he was transfused
packed red blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma as
needed.

On postoperative day one, he continued to be intubated and
his creatinine bumped up to 1.5.  CKs had been sent off,
which were 399, 4,525, and 4,092 with MBs of 10 and 64.  His
electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without
ST-T-wave changes.  He was weaned to extubate on
postoperative day one.  His hematocrit was 29.8 and he was
transferred for a hematocrit greater than 30.  His
coagulopathy began to resolve and his PT was 13.6, PTT 38.0,
and INR 1.2.

On postoperative day two, he was doing much better, making
good urine, and his hematocrit was stable.  On postoperative
day three, he was transferred to the floor due to his stable
condition.  His tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus,
gastrocnemius, iliopsoas, and quadriceps were all [**4-30**] and his
sensation was intact to light touch.  His hematocrit was
stable at 32.9.  He continued to have low platelets of 89,000
and was transfused accordingly.  His creatinine remained
slightly elevated at 1.6.

On [**7-1**], he was having difficulty with emesis secondary to
his pain medications.  His Hemovac continued to put out less
fluid.  His laboratory studies showed his hematocrit to be
stable at 33.2, platelets 117,000, and his creatinine fell to
1.3.  He was begun back on the IV morphine until he was
taking better po, at which time he was restarted on po pain
medication.  He was evaluated by both Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy which felt that a rehabilitation stay
would be warranted in him.

He continued to do well and his Hemovac was discontinued.
His diet was advanced as tolerated, and his pain was under
good control.  His Foley was discontinued and he was voiding
appropriately.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to rehabilitation in
stable condition on [**3149-7-3**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Included Levoxyl 0.05 mg po q day,
Lipitor 10 mg po q day, Vicodin one to two tablets po q four
