   Assessment and Plan
   83-year-old woman with respiratory distress.  There is likely a mix of
   COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and cardiac disease.
   Pneumonia
   This is HCAP
 will cover for MRSA, PSA, and atypicals for now.  Check
   cultures
   COPD
   Continue prednisone and bronchodilators
   Get records of PFTs
 numbers are very severe
   Heart failure
   Check echocardiogram given murmur.  This is billed as diastolic CHF,
   but on exam I am concerned about aortic stenosis.
   Tachycardia
   Appears sinus.  Etiology is not completely clear.  [**Month (only) 56**] be related to
   nebs, pneumonia, or hypovolemia.  Will hold off on usual diuretics for
   today.
   Other issues as per ICU team note.
   [**Month (only) 56**] be ready for the floor later today.
