Chief Complaint:
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  chest pain
REASON FOR CCU ADMISSION: STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterizaztion [**3102-4-23**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 49y/o gentleman with HTN, HLD, hiatal
hernia/GERD and gout who presented to the ED with chest pain and
is admitted to the CCU s/p cardiac catheterization after being
found to have a STEMI.
.
He is a software programmer and is not very active at baseline,
though he walks at work and says he can climb 5 flights of
stairs without ever having chest pain but might have mild
shortness of breath.  He has a hiatal hernia & GERD which causes
frequent heartburn.
.
He was in this usual state of health until 2 days ago when he
felt the gradual onset of heartburn/reflux, not associated with
exertion or with food.  It was persistent and he was surprised
that it was not relieved with his PPI or by chewing gum as his
usual heartburn is; the pain kept him awake that night.  Then
yesterday around dinnertime the discomfort changed and he began
experiencing dull substernal chest pain that was worse with
breathing, causing a feeling of shortness of breath because he
has been trying to take very shallow breaths.  The pain only
came on with breathing, and with deep breaths extended to
include his [**Last Name (un) 23262**]/jaw/shoulders.  No diaphoresis.  The discomfort
seemed to be worse when lying down so he slept in a chair.  When
the pain was still there in the morning he decided to come to
the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T97.8, HR 88, BP 131/98, RR 16,
POx  97% RA.  EKG showed I + aVL, as well as V2-V6, and Q waves
in II, III, aVF and V3-V6.  Labs were notable for troponin 2.53,
Cr 1.2, WBC 23.3.  He received ASA 325mg, Plavix 600mg,
Metoprolol 15mg IV, received a Heparin bolus, and was started on
an Integrillin drip.  Due to evidence of anterior STEMI, he was
taken to the cath lab.  Was found to have LAD with diffuse
proximal and mid irregularities, distal totally occluded; no
collaterals.  No intervention was pursued.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient feels fine but does have [**6-1**]
chest pain with inspiration, exactly the same as last night and
this morning.  The pain was not present during the procedure
today but is there now.  Otherwise feels fine.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is pertinent for intermittent ankle
swelling (which he says started after starting Norvasc, and
happens at the end of the day).  No dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

EKG [**3102-4-23**]:
Sinus rhythm. Diffuse ST segment elevation in the context of
evidence of
recent or ongoing inferoposterolateral myocardial infarction and
probable
acute anterior ischemic process as well. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

CXR [**3102-4-23**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial
decrease in lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of
mild fluid
overload. The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot
be excluded.
Relatively extensive retrocardiac and left basal atelectasis but
no indication for pneumonia.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**3102-4-23**]: [final report pending]
LAD with diffuse proximal and mid irregularities, distal totally
occluded; no collaterals.  No intervention was pursued.

TTE [**3102-4-23**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) secondary to
akinesis of the apex and distal segments of all LV walls. The
remaining segments contract normally. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
moderate regional and global systolic dysfunction c/w CAD or
takotsubo cardiomyopathy. No significant valvular disease.

CXR [**3102-4-24**]:
1. Improved aeration in the lungs.
2. Left basilar atelectasis and small pleural effusion.

EKG [**3102-4-25**]:
Sinus rhythm. Q waves in leads II, III and aVF indicating an old
inferior
myocardial infarction. Q waves in leads V4-V6 with ST segment
elevation
in leads V3-V6 and biphasic T waves in lead V2 and that inverted
T wave
in lead V1 indicating an acute anterior myocardial infarction.
However, there are also ST segment elevations in leads I, II,
and ST segment depressions in lead aVR which may indicate a
pericarditis process. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 49y/o gentleman with coronary risk factors of
HTN, HLD, and family history of early CAD who presented with
STEMI.  During this admission, his MI was treated medically (no
intervention), and he was treated for pericarditis as well as
apical aneurysm/akinesis with no complications and he was
discharged home.
.
#. Anterior/lateral/inferior STEMI: totally occluded distal LAD.
His "heartburn" 2 days prior to admission that was different
from his usual GERD likely represented ACS.  Presented 48 hours
out from that event, with no more heartburn (though had
pleuritic pain - please see below).  Q waves already present, no
hemodynamic instability or dynamic changes to suggest that
intervention at this point would be beneficial (and besides,
lesion was 100% occluded) so his STEMI was managed medically.
His pleuritic pain likely represents post-MI pericarditis (see
below).  Other complications of his MI included apical
aneurysm/akinesis (see below).  He was monitored in the CCU for
more serious complications of STEMI, but he had none.  Note that
persistent ST elevations could reflect his recent ACS, his
pericarditis (there are some PR depressions), and/or LV
aneurysm.  He was discharged on ASA (will take anti-inflammatory
dose for 1 week then continue with 81mg indefinitely); statin
was changed from Crestor 5mg to Atorvastatin 80mg; his beta
blocker (Carvedilol) was uptitrated; his RAAS blocker (Losartan)
was continued at lower dose.  He was Plavix-loaded but no
indication to continue Plavix.  He will follow-up with his
Cardiologist after discharge.
.
#. Peri-infarct pericarditis: still has mild pleuritic chest
pain.
He has pleuritic chest pain that is somewhat positional, and EKG
could be consistent.  No rub.  No effusion on TTE.  He is being
treated with high-dose ASA (650mg PO TOD x1 week).  Colchicine
was not started; his pain was reasonably controlled on aspirin.

.
#. Apical akinesis, ?LV aneurysm: started on Warfarin.
TTE showed symmetric akinesis of the apex, mild aneurysm as
well.  He was started on Heparin gtt and was transitioned to
Warfarin (note, was discharged before fully anticoagulated as no
clear evidence for bridge).  He was discharged on Warfarin and
will follow up at his Cardiologist's office for INR check and
management of anticoagulation.
.
#. LV EF 25-30%: euvolemic on discharge.
No intervention was pursued for his lesion but it is possible
that his EF will improve somewhat.  He is already on a beta
blocker and a RAAS blocker.  He will follow up with his
Cardiologist and will likely have a follow-up TTE in the future.
.
#. Mild hypoxia: resolved.
He was 88%RA on the morning after presentation.  Differential
included pulmonary edema (mildly depressed EF, but CXR was not
very convincing for edema, and he seemed otherwise euvolemic).
PE was considered but did not fit with clinical picture and ABG
was not concerning.  With deep breaths his O2 rose to 91%RA; the
most likely etiology for his hypoxia was splinting from
pericarditis pain, along with likely underlying obesity
hypoventilation.  His pain was controlled and by the time of
discharge his O2 sat was >90%RA.  He might benefit from
outpatient sleep study.

#. Leukocytosis: resolved, likely related to MI.
No localizing signs/symptoms to suggest infection.  Leukocytosis
likely from MI or pericarditis.  CXR was not concerning and his
WBC normalized by discharge.

#. HTN: BP reasonably controlled.
He was continued on Carvedilol, which was uptitrated for better
HR control.  As a result, he was able to be discharged off
Amlodipine.  His Losartan dose was decreased.  He will follow up
with his PCP and Cardiologist.
.
#. HLD: stable.
His statin was chaned from Crestor 5mg to Atorvastatin 80mg
daily.
.

-PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/or Cardiologist to follow up lipid control (changed
from Crestor 5mg to Atorvaststin 80mg)

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **],

It was a pleasure treating you during your hospitalization. You
were admitted to [**Hospital1 170**] after
having a heart attack. You have a complete blockage in your left
anterior descending artery (LAD) which we are treating with
medications at this time. As a result of the heart attack you
have some apical wall motion abnormalities in your heart which
will have to be monitored.

Because your heart is not pumping normally after the heart
attack you need to be cautious about fluid build up. You should
weigh yourself every morning and call your doctor if weight goes
up more than 3 lbs in 3 days or 5 lbs in 2 days.  Follow a low
salt diet and try to restrict your fluid intake to [**3089**] ml per
day.

In addition, due to the abnormal movement/shape of the bottom of
the heart (apical aneurysm, apical akinesis), you are at risk
for blood clot formation in the heart so you are being
discharged home on a blood thinner (Warfarin).  You will need to
have the blood level of this medication checked frequently (INR,
goal is between 2 and 3).  Please follow up at Dr.[**Name (NI) 1370**] office
on Tuesday to have the blood level checked.

The chest pain you are experiencing that is worse with breathing
is likely due to "pericarditis," or inflammation of the tissue
layer around the heart, which can happen after a heart attack.
For this, you are being treated with high-dose aspirin for 1
week (and then you will be decreased to the lower-dose Aspirin,
which you will continue indefinitely for your coronary artery
disease.  If you experience chest pressure of atypical heartburn
again, take Nitroglycerin under your tongue as directed. If the
pain does not go away, call 911.

Medication changes:
- STOP your Norvasc (Amlodipine)
- STOP your Crestor
- STOP taking Ibuprofen
- DECREASE your Losartan to 25mg daily
- INCREASE your Carvedilol to 50mg twice daily
- INCREASE your Aspirin to 650mg three times a day until [**3102-4-29**]
- After [**3102-4-29**] resume Aspirin 81mg daily (baby aspirin)
- START Atorvastatin 80mg Daily
- START Coumadin (Warfarin) at 5mg daily:

Followup Instructions:
ANTICOAGULATION - DR.[**Last Name (STitle) **] OFFICE
***You will need to have blood work on Tuesday [**4-29**] to check
the INR (measure of blood thinning), electrolytes and kidney
function.  These should be followed up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
