TITLE: PGY3 MICU Admission Note
   Chief Complaint:  cardiac arrest
   HPI:
   46 year old man with history of ESRD on HD, CAD, systolic CHF (EF 20%),
   prior cardiac arrest s/p ICD implantation for secondary prevention
   presenting with a cardiac arrest.  He was recently at [**Hospital1 52**] for
   attempted ICD revision due to a malfunctioning ICD lead ([**Date range (1) 5441**]).
   However, the procedure was not done as his INR was >2.  He was
   scheduled to come back to [**Hospital1 52**] on [**3329-10-24**] for elective admission and
   lead revision.
   His mother, who lives with him, stated that he has felt poorly since ~
   2 weeks ago after he had a cardiac arrest at HD.  At that time he was
   shocked and had CPR and sent to [**Hospital 1899**] Hospital.  He has had chest
   pain eversince.  She stated that he was complaining of chest pain and
   had not been able to fill the lidocaine patches that had been
   prescribed from his recent [**Hospital1 52**] admission.  He ate poorly in the
   evening. She stated that he gets dialysis on MWF and had a shortened
   session on Friday as he returned home early (likely due to low blood
   pressure on the HD circuit). Approximately at 1AM, he called him mother
   to his room for chest pain.  She found him diaphoretic and gasping for
   air.  He lay on the floor and had his eyes roll in his head and yelled
   to his mother to help him.  She called EMS. Found pt agonal by EMS -
   wide complex on monitor.  Intubated in the field, CPR, 2 epis given per
   EMS.  There was intermittant ROSC. In [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 5442**] ED lost pulse with
   reported sine wave/WCT on monitor. Tx for hyperK then received
   additional dose of Epi x 1 + shock at 200 with ROSC and reported
   narrowing of the WCT (tele strips not sent with patient).  Following
   that he required no further pressors/fluids - SBP 100-120 HR 80-100.
   Initial report from the lab was a K of
 - 2nd round of
   bicarb/D50+insulin + kayex via ngt given.  Actual result reported by
   computer was 4.3.    Kayexelate suctioned from ngt.  Repeat K was drawn
   -- 5.5 (non-hemolyzed). It is not clear if his hyperkalemia was ever
   severe and no tele strips were sent with the patient.
   He was transfered to [**Hospital1 52**] for further evaluation.  On arrival to the
   [**Hospital1 52**] ED he was described as awake and moving all 4 [**Last Name (LF) 5443**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he
   was not placed on the cooling protocol.  His initial vital signs were
   97.5  62  107/75  14  100%.  He was sedated was prn versed.  A repeat K
   was 5 and lactate 7.4.  His EKG was interpreted as LBBB unchanged from
   priors.

   TTE ([**3329-10-10**]) - The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
   markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
   Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The basal lateral wall moves best and the
   remaining segments are akinetic.. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
   left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
   ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. There is no mass/thrombus in the right ventricle. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There
   is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Microbiology: none

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year old man with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p PCI with hx
   of SCD s/p ICD implanation c/b ICD malfunction, ESRD on HD presenting
   with cardiac arrest.
   1) Cardiac arrest: the patient's initial rhythm was pulseless VT. He
   has an ischemic substrate and a history of SCD and with his
   malfunctioning ICD, this was the likely trigger to the events.  He has
   missed no dialysis sessions and it is unlikely that primary
   hyperkalemia would be the primary cause to the arrthymia in the absence
   of regional organ hypoperfusion and massive cellular breakdown.  EKG is
   unremarkable for dramatic concordant or discordant ST segment changes
   and initial cardiac enzymes are remarkably low which would point away
   from ACS as driving cause.  he has shown neurologic recovery (prior to
   sedation) and does not meet criteria for cooling. alternative
   explanation was CHF exacerbation with hypoxia driving pulseless arrest,
   however patient not total body wet.
   - EP consult +/- CCU transfer
   - r/o MI, monitor on tele
   - daily neuro exams off sedation to assess mental status recovery
   2) ESRD on HD: it is unclear what his primary renal disease is.
   however currently he has adequate HD access. Has K = 5 and acidosis
   adequately controlled with ventilation.
   - renal recs
   - phos-binders per renal
   - HD today
   3) Cardiac:
   ischemia: r/o MI although low prob for ACS
   - aspirin 325 mg until r/o complete then 81 mg thereafter
   - continue beta-blocker
   - continue statin
   - hold heparin
   rhythm: pulseless VT as above
   - EP consult
   - amiodarone gtt for now
   - telemetry
   pump: euvolemic except for pulmonary edema.
   - volume control
   - beta-block as able
   4) Respiratory failure: currently gas exchanging well on the vent. mild
   pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - PSV trial
   - light sedation with fentanyl
   - follow ABG
   - VAP prevention

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 46M ESRD, DCM s/p multiple LAD stents and EF
   of 20% / LV thrombus on coumadin with history of cardiac arrest and
   AICD, which was scheduled for revision. Arrested at home, initially had
   elevated K but on repeat was in the 5-6 range.
   Exam notable for Tm 96.4 BP 103/67 HR 60 (paced) RR 14 with sat 99 on
   A/C 550x14, 0.4, PEEP 5, ABG 7.39/43/314. PERRL, decreased movement LUE
   but arousable and follows some commands. Chest clear, RRR s1s2 [**3-9**] SM.
   Abdomen is soft, now edema. Labs notable for WBC 16K, HCT 32, K+ 5.0,
   Cr P, lactate 7.4, Trop 0.06. CXR with clear lungs, EKG LB3 / paced.
   Agree with plan to discuss with EP / CCU service given likely primary
   arrhythmic event; needs device interrogation and likely revision based
   on prior plan. For now, will continue amiodarone IV and monitor on
   telemetry. Will check CT head to exclude focal lesion given question of
   L weakness / neglect on exam and hold anticoagulation. No role for
   cooling given generally good prognosis based on exam and distance out
   from arrest. Continue ASA, BBL and statin, though not obviously
   ischemic at this time. Will get renal evaluation and likely
   hemodialysis once rhythm issues have settled. Continue mechanical
   ventilation and sedation until need for further procedures has been
   clarified. Continue NPO, RISS (not diabetic), and H2B for prophylaxis.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
