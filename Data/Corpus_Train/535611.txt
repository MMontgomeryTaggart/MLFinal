   Assessment and Plan
   39M with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic vent dependency,
   presenting with acute onset of RUQ pain, nausea, acute jaundice with
   findings of gallstones on RUQ US.
   .
   #. Choledocolithiasis s/p ERCP ([**11-1**]): Patient with improving bilirubin
   and jaundice, LFTs are holding steady. Per surgery recs will trend out
   amylase and lipase from yesterday and today to ensure resolution.
   Albumin, platelets, coags normal so not suggestive of decreased liver
   function/liver failure.  Liver serologies negative.
   - f/u ERCP recs
   - trend bili, LFT, amylase/lipase
   - Advance diet as tolerated
   # Low serum bicarb/anion gap: Patient with some ketones in UA, may be
   secondary to ketosis. Patient is not a known diabetic, and is not
   uremic. Will continue to follow chemistries. Clinically patient is
   doing well and asymptomcatic.
   -          Repeat Chem-7
   -          Work up if abnormal
   .
   #. Chronic respiratory failure: s/p trach, vent dependent since '[**19**]. At
   home baseline, he is vent dependent, suctioned twice a day and is using
   a mechanical cough supplementation device. Patient without respiratory
   complaints currently.
   - continue home albuterol and atrovent standing nebs
   - continue home vent settings
   -PT therapy, cough assist
   .
   #. Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy:
   - continue on home vent settings, turn patient to prevent ulcers
   .
   #. h/o long QT interval, known RBBB: Patient had prior holter monitor
   which revealed isolated PVC's and infrequent ventricular couplets.
   This is consistant with DMD and known cardiomyopathies.
   - check EKG with AM rounds
   - monitor in telemetry
   - avoid haldol or other medications which prolong QT
   .
   #. HTN- patient with hypotensive episodes overnight, will hold on
   lisinopril and restart when hemodynamically stable
   -hold lisinopril
   -bolus as needed for hypotension
   .
   #. FEN

   lytes prn
