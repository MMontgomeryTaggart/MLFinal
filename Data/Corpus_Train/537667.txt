   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 363**] yo male with prolonged hosptial course following initial admission
   with altered mental status and hypernatremia.  He did have urinary
   system stones identified and implicated in generation of acute renal
   failure with obstruction now improved.  In that setting he is now
   admitted with alteration in mental status and respiratory distress to
   ICU and has shown reasonable response to chagne in VCL and some mild
   volume support and broad spectrum antibiotics.
   1)Respiratory Distress-
   -Vanco/cefepime/Flagyl started but patient has rapid resolution of
   respiratory compromise which argues largely against primary pulmonary
   insult.  Distress may well have been related to SIRS from persistent
   urinary source.
   2)Sepsis-
   -Possible urine source, this may have been suggestive of urinary source
   of persistent SIRS and altered mental status, resp distress.
   -Klebsiella seen and will Rx with CTX
   -C-Diff
PO Flagyl
   3)Altered Mental Status-
   -Patient near baseline
   -Will continue to Rx medical issues as they present and maintain
   hypernatremia stability via free H2O replacement
