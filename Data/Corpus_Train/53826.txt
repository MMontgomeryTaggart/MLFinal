Pertinent Results:
[**2706-5-14**] Intra-op TEE:
Conclusions
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium.
3. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
4. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal.
5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
6. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

POST-CPB: On phenylephrine briefly. AV pacing, then NSR.
Preserved biventricular systolic function post CPB. LVEF is now
65%. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) 556**] aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 52**] on [**2706-5-10**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease and required Plavix
washout. On [**2706-5-14**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was taken to the Operating
Room where the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
to four vessels. Please see operative note for details. Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring. He was initially hypoxic and his
extubation was deferred for several hours. He eventually
extubated late in the evening and required high flow oxygen.
Patient was a smoker pre-op. He remained in the unit for several
days due to continued hypoxia and the need for pulmonary
toileting. He was started on beta blocker and aggressive
diuresis which he has tolerated well. Pacing wires and chest
tubes were discontinued without incident. Eventually on POD #4
he was transferred to the  floor for the remainder of his
post-op course. He had been very motivated and was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics and he was weaned to room air with oxygen
saturation of 88-93% on room air with ambulation 94% on room air
at rest. The patient was discharged home with visiting nurse
services in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.  Cardiac service office to call patient on Mon [**5-21**]
with follow up appointment times and dates.
