Chief Complaint:  Reason for admission:  vascular surgery evaluation
   for right heel ulcer
   .
   Reason for transfer to MICU:  Ongoing hypotension, hypothermia,
   anasarca, and inability to tolerate HD for fluid removal
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 5137**] was admitted on [**3211-12-29**] for vascular surgery evaluation of
   right heel ulcer.  She was started on vanco/cipro/flagyl on admission
   to cover an infection.  On hospital day 2 ([**3211-12-30**]), she underwent
   right peroneal angioplasty on [**3211-12-30**] and was put on an argatroban
   drip for 24 hours following hte procedure.  On [**12-31**], she was noted to
   be hypotensive to 72/37 and hypothermic to 94.6.  Cardiac enzymes were
   check and were noted to be positive.  She was transfused 2 units PRBCs
   on [**12-31**]. Plastic surgery was consulted for evaluation of sacral decub,
   but declined to debride wound due to aspirin/plavix/argatroban use.
   She underwent HD on [**3212-1-1**], but they were unable to remove fluid due
   to low blood pressures.  When renal evaluted her on that day, there was
   concern that her mental status was not at baseline and her words were
   not well enunciated.  They recommended sending blood cultures and
   broadening antibiotics but this was not done.  Cardiology was consulted
   on [**1-1**] for bradycardia, hypotension, and elevated cardiac enzymes,
   who had no specific recommendations other than to d/c beta-blockers.
   An echo was performed on [**1-2**] which showed new regional wall motion
   abnormalities. Given hypotension, anasarca, and inability to tolerate
   HD due to low BPs, patient was transfered to MICU for CVVH.
   .
   Upon arrival to the MICU, patient reports right hand pain.  She denies
   any other complaints.  No abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
   fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain.

   IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic
   function most c/w CAD. Mildly dilated RV with mild global hypokinesis.
   Mild pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
   regurgitation.
   .
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3211-6-6**], the
   regional left ventricular dysfunction is new and c/w interim ischemia.
   The severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly increased.
   .
   CXR. [**3212-1-3**].
   Since yesterday, sternotomy for CABG is again seen. Interstitial edema
   is new. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion with associated bibasilar
   atelectasis are unchanged. Cardiomegaly is stable. There is no other
   overall change.
   .
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 5137**] is a 78 year old female with type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p
   BKA, CAD s/p MI, admitted to vascular surgery for right peroeneal
   angiopalsty on [**12-30**] now with ongoing hypotension, hypotheremia, and
   need for more aggressive volume removal with CVVH.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient noted to be hypotensive throughout five day
   hospital stay, routinely having blood pressures in the 70s and 80s.
   She has been noted to be mentating, but there has been concern that her
   mental status is not her baseline per renal (will need to confirm with
   family).  Patient has warm extremities and multiple possible infectious
   sources (RLE heel ulcer, sacral decub, RUE cellulitis) making septic
   shock a strong possibility.  In addition, patient has a history of
   endocarditis with no evidence of vegetations on TTE, but TEE not
   performed.  Less likely etiology of hypotension is cardiogenic shock
   given the finding of new regional wall motion abnormalities consistent
   with ischemia on echo and elevated cardiac enzymes (Trop 0.2 --> 0.2
   --> 0.15 with flat CK).  Patient appears hypervolemia.  Given rising
   WBC, ongoing hypotension, and history of multiple resistant organisms
   in past (VRE, MRSA, cipro-resistant pseudomonas, will cover broadly
   with dapto/[**Last Name (un) 411**]/flagyl.
   - d/c vanco/cipro and start dapto/[**Last Name (un) 411**]
   - continue flagyl until C. diff is negative given abx exposures
   - Daily EKGs
   - check cortisol
   - levophed to maintain MAPS> 56
   - f/u blood culture and stool culture; CXR
   .
   ESRD on dialysis.  Likely secondary to diabetes and HTN.  Patient has
   been getting dialysis 3xweek, but unable to remove volume due to low
   blood pressures.  Now grossly fluid overloaded (?> 30 kg up from dry
   weight) though not requiring supplemental oxygen.  HD line placed
   today.
   - CVVH with goal of 200-300 cc/hour
   - levophed to maintain MAPs> 65 so CVVH can be tolerated
   - no priming of pump due to h/o HIT
   - renal following
   - CXR to evaluate for interstitial edema/fluid overload
   .
   Sacral decubitus ulcer.  Patient was evaluated by plastics for possible
   debridement, however, they are unwilling to debride the wound in
   setting of plavix use.  They recommend improvement of nutritional
   status, frequent turning, and kinaire bed.
   - nutrition
   - vitamin C and zinc
   - logroll q2hr
   - continue kinair bed
   -sacral ulcer: place duoderm over ulcer that is surrounding the
   eschar, then dry 4X4 guaze and ABD pad over entire ulcer
   -Bilater ischial ulcers: place duoderm and allevyn over ulcers
   -we will continue to follow with you
   .
   Heel ulcer.  Patient is s/p right peroneal angioplasty for righ limb
   ischemia who now has right heel necrosis.  Has been evaluated by
   podiatry.
   - multipodis boots
   - podiatry following
   .
   CAD s/p MI.  Patient noted to have new regional wall motion
   abnormalities consistent with ischemia.  Has had two CABGs in past.
   Troponin mildly elevated in setting of renal failure with flat CK not
   suggestive of an acute event.
   - aspirin, plavix, statin
   - hold BB due to hypotension
   .
   Hyponatremia.  Patient appear hypervolemic.  Hyponatremia has worsened
   during hospital stay though patient is on D51/2NS upon arrival to MICu.
   - free water restrict
   - fluid removal with CVVH
   - d/c D51/2NS
   - follow Na
   - check urine lytes, osms
   .
   Leukocytosis.  WBC has been elevated since admission on [**12-29**], though
   is rising of the past few days.  Patient has had no documented fevers,
   though as been hypothermic several times during hospital stay,
   concerning for infectious etiology.  Numerous possible infectious
   sources include her sacral decub, right heel ulcer.
   - follow WBC
   - continue broad spectrum abx
   - follow fever curve
   - follow up blood cultures, stool culture, CXR
   .
   Anemia.  Baseline Hct between 25 and 32.  Currently 24.8.  Has ESRD,
   history of ACD, and history of chronic GI bleeds due to AVMs and PUD.
   Iron studies on [**12-30**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
   - consider initiation of epo, will discuss with renal
   - guaiac stools
   - follow Hct
   .
   Thrombocytopenia.  Thombocytopenia < 100 since [**3205**].  Has history of
   HIT in the past.  Unclear etiology of chronic thrombocytopenia, but
   currently stable.
   - follow plts
   - no heparin due to HIT
   .
   Type 2 DM.  Patient has diabetes.  S/p BKA.
   - insulin SS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   RUE edema.  RUE negative on [**3212-1-3**].  Concerning for cellulitis,
   particularly in setting of rising WBC and hypotension.
   - continue dapto/[**Last Name (un) 411**]
   - f/u blood cultures
   - follow fever, wbc curve
   .
   Elevated INR.  Elevated INR, though not on anticoagulation.   Likely
   secondary to malnutrition and antibiotic use.
   - vitamin K
   - follow coags
   .
   Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Asthma.
   - continue albuterol, atrovent, advair
   .
   Nutrition.  Patient with albumin of 1.6.  Likely with poor PO intake.
   Will need nutrition consult.  Needs improved nutrition for wound
   healing.
   Ppx: home PPI, pneumoboots (no HSQ due to h/o HIT)
   Nutition: diabetic diet
   ICU care
   Will need to address code status with family/HCP due to patient
   mental status.
