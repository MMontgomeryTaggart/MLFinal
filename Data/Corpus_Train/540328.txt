   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 47 yo F with HIV not on HARRT (last CD4 327 with VL 136K in [**5-26**])
   who presents with fevers, cough, diarrhea and multifocal pneumonia.
   .
   # fevers, cough: CXR suggests multifocal pneumonia and u/a suggests
   UTI. There was concern for hypotension in the ED and she was given 8L
   IVF and started on levophed. ? sepsis from pneumonia and UTI.
   -will continue broad spectrum antibiotics including vanco, ceftriaxone
   and levofloxacin for atypicals. Her last CD4 would make PCP unlikely
   but that was from [**2787-5-19**] and she had a noticable VL at the time and
   not on HAART. So reasonable to continue bactrim for ?PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] given
   multifocal pneumonia. She was mildly hypoxic to low 90s on RA in the
   ED.  Will recheck CD4 count and if > 200, will stop Bactrim.
   -follow up blood cultures, urine culture
   -send sputum culture (induced) to for gram stain and to rule out PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 3642**] repeating ABG to assess for hypoxia and consider steroids,
   although suspicion is low at this time.  Will reassess after CD4 count
   returns.
   .
   # sepsis/hypotension: likely secondary to several sources of infection
   (pneumonia and UTI). Unclear what her baseline BP is given she was
   mentating normally despite hypotension and lactate was 1 in the ED. She
   was given plenty of IVF in the ED (8liters).
   -monitor CVP- currently 13
   -monitor lactate
   -ween levophed as tolerated
   -f/u culture data as above
   .
   # trichomonas seen in U/A: treat with flagyl.  Other pathogens with
   +UTI will be covered with Levo.
   .
   # headache: does not seem as though meningitis is a problem here. [**Name2 (NI) 55**]
   focal signs and no neck stiffness. INR too high for LP especially given
   low concern currently.
   -if headache does not resolve, consider LP
   .
   # acute renal failure: Cr elevated to 1.4 from baseline 1.1. Likely
   prerenal given description of being clinically dry on exam in the ED.
   Currently euvolemic.
   -monitor Cr.
   .
   # afib: currently rate controlled.
   -hold metoprolol while on pressors
   -hold coumadin given supratherapeutic currently
   .
   # hx of pulmonary nodules: followed by CT scans, last CT [**12-26**].  CT scan
   likely to show infiltrate with acute event.
   - will monitor status and if no improvement in a few days, can consider
   repeating it
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy: EF 20-25% per echo this year.
   - holding ACE and B-blocker due to hypotension, consider adding as
   sepsis resolves
   .
   # Substance Abuse: pt reports smoking cocaine today.
   - urine and serum tox screens
   - SW and addiction consults
   .
   # HTN: currently on pressors
   -hold lisinopril and metoprolol
   .
   # HIV: last CD4 was in [**5-26**] 327 and VL was 136K. Not on HAART given
   poor compliance.
   -check CD4 count
   -ID consult in AM
   -she was on ppx bactrim and fluconazole
   .
   # depression: per patient, fluoxetine was not helping and she was not
   currently taking it.  Continue ativan.
   .
   # FEN: low salt diet. Hold IVF for now.
   .
   # PPX: supratherapeutic on coumadin for DVT ppx, bowel regimen, no GI
   ppx indicated
   .
   # Code: full, confirmed with patient
   .
   # Comm: patient (per pt, has health care proxy who is currently
   incarcerated.
