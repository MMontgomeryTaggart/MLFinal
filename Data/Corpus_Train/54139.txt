Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3088**]
Chief Complaint:
Unwitnessed fall with left traumatic subarachnoid hematoma, left
frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and right subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
89 y/o male found down, unresponsive, by neighbor with obvious
head trauma, bleeding from his right ear, and no recollction of
events.  Patient complains of dizziness throughout the day
before his unwitnessed fall.  He reports episode chest pain two
days prior to admission that responded to sublingual
nitroglycerin.

Patient was brought to ED at [**Hospital1 52**], where the neurosurgery
service was consulted.  Initial imaging revealed small right
subarachnoid hemorrhage with right temporal bone fracture.
However, in the ED, patient developed hemataemesis, prompting
repeat imaging.  Repeat imaging revealed new left frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mass effect.  As such, the
patient was admitted to the ICU for further management and
monitoring.

Upon admission, patient denies any chest pain, headache,
weakness or paresthesia and complains of difficulty hearing from
right ear with drainage from that ear.

MICROBIO:
-Urine cx ([**5-16**]): NEGATIVE
-Blood cx ([**5-16**]): NEGATIVE

Imaging:

[**2938-5-16**] 1608 CT Spine w/o contrast:
Right perched facet and left jumped facet with splaying of the
spinous process at C6-C7 appears chronic.  No definite acute
fracture.  If
concern for superimposed acute injury or cord injury, MRI is the
study of
choice if patient is able to tolerate the exam.

[**2938-5-16**] 1607 CT Head w/o contrast:
1.  Right temporoparietal and interhemispheric fissure
subarachnoid blood.  Small blood product adjacent to left
tentorium suggesteive of trace subdural hematoma.  3 mm right
inferior frontal subdural hematoma.
2.  Right temporal bone fracture with otic capsule sparing and
small focus of pneumocephalus.
3.  Small pneumocephalus in left temporal region.
4.  Partial opacification of left mastoid air cells with
adjacent chronic
changes.  No fracture is seen.

[**2938-5-16**] 1842 CT Head w/o contrast:
1.  Right temporal bone fracture extending into the mastoid air
cells to the external auditory canal.  No evidence of facial
nerve involvement.  Small pneumocephalus in the right temporal
lobe.
2.  Unchanged right temporal lobe subarachnoid hemorrhage.
3.  Small pneumocephalus in the left temporal lobe of unclear
etiology. No
left temporal bone fracture identified.

[**2938-5-16**] 2142 CT Head w/o contrast:
1.  Newly-apparent large left frontal parenchymal hemorrhagic
contusion with surrounding edema and mild mass effect.
2.  New tiny left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
3.  New tiny intraventricular blood in the right lateral
ventricle occipital [**Doctor Last Name **].
4.  The right frontal subdural hemorrhage, left tentorial
subdural hemorrhage and right temporoparietal subarachnoid
hemorrhage are stable.

[**2938-5-17**] 0748 CT Head w/o contrast:
1.  Interval increase in size of left frontal parenchymal
hemorrhagic
contusion, with 5 mm of rightward subfalcine herniation.
2.  Extensive bihemispheric subarachnoid, small intraventricular
hemorrhage, right middle cranial fossa subdural hematoma, all
unchanged over the short-interval.
3.  Grossly unchanged appearance of known right temporal bone
fracture.

[**2938-5-18**] 0930 CT Head w/o contrast:
1.  Stable left frontal hematoma since most recent preceding
exam, with
persistent peripheral edema and rightward displacement of the
left frontal
rectus gyrus.
2.  Similar extent of bilateral multi-compartmental hemorrhage
including left parietal and bilateral temporal subarachnoid
hemorrhage, intraventricular and supratentorial components.
3.  Right temporal bone fracture, better delineated on dedicated
temporal bone CT two days ago.

[**2938-5-19**] Carotid Ultrasound:  Right ICA no stenosis.  Left ICA
<40% stenosis.

[**2938-5-19**] Echocardiogram:
IMPRESSION: EF > 55% Suboptimal image quality. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mildly
dilated aortic sinus.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2933-7-13**],
the severity of aortic regurgitation is minimally increased.

[**2938-5-20**] EEG: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow disorganized
background throughout. This indicates a widespread
encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
infection are most common causes. There were no areas of
persistent focal slowing but encephalopathies may obscure focal
findings. There were no epileptiform features or electrographic
seizures.

[**2938-5-23**] Bilateral Lower Extremity Venous Doppler:
1.  Deep venous thrombosis of the left popliteal vein, which
appears partially occlusive.
2.  In comparison to [**2931-8-31**] exam, there is interval increase
in size of a partially thrombosed right popliteal artery
aneurysm, now measuring 7.5 cm.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the neuro-ICU on [**2938-5-16**] after interval
imaging in the ED revealed new left frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.  Patient was admitted with dysarthria, confusion,
and decreased hearing in his right ear, and no localizing or
lateralizing signs.  He was loaded with dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis with concomitant gastric protection.  Urinalysis was
suspicious for UTI and patient was started on a 3 day course of
ciprofloxacin.

Repeat imaging revealed interval increase in size of left
frontal parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion.  The patient's
neurologic [**Date Range **] improved.  His confusing cleared,
dysarthria improved, and he continued to not exhibit
lateralizing symptoms. His decreased hearing in the right ear
persisted.  As patient was more stable, he was transferred to
the neuro stepdown unit.

On [**2938-5-18**], interval head CT revealed the left frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage to be stable.  The neurological
[**Date Range **] continued improved and the patient was A&O x2
(hospital, self).  As hearing had not returned, and ENT consult
was placed.  The ENT service placed an ear wick to manage the
otorrhea that is to be in place x5 days and recommended ciprodex
4gtt AD [**Hospital1 9**] x10 days.

On [**2938-5-19**], the care team pursued work-up for syncopal episode,
included carotid Doppler, EEG, and echocardiogram.  EEG showed
disorganized background consistent with encephalopathy with no
epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.  Carotid
Doppler demonstrated no stenosis of the right ICA and < 40%
stenosis of left ICA.  Echocardiogram showed EF > 55% with mild
aortic regurgitation.  To ensure patient was safe to take in po,
a speech and swallow evaluation was conducted.  The speech
therapists recommended a thin liquid and regular solid diet.

On [**2938-5-20**], patient was evaluated by PT/OT.  They recommended
discharge to rehabilitation.  The earwick placed by ENT was
removed.

On [**2938-5-21**], the neurosurgery team transitioned the patient to
oral ciprofloxacin and discontinued the patient's Foley.
Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler [**Date Range **] on [**2938-5-23**]
revealed deep venous thrombosis of the left popliteal vein,
which appears partially occlusive and interval increase in size
of a  partially thrombosed right popliteal artery aneurysm.
Patient was started on Lovenox 90 mg SC BID, decreased to 90mg
daily given elevated Xa level, borderline creatinine clearance,
and h/o recent head bleed. He is to continuous this therapy for
6 months. He should have factor Xa level rechecked on [**2938-5-26**] in
rehab to ensure that he is therapeutic on Lovenox.

Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 25159**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] remained unchanged and he was discharged
to rehabilitation on [**2938-5-24**].
