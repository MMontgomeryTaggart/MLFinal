HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old white
female patient with no previous history of coronary artery
disease who presented after approximately 12 hours of
intermittent stuttering chest pain radiating to bilateral
arms. She did also have shortness of breath and nausea.  She
presented to an outside hospital emergency department with
chest pain.  Her electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in
the lateral leads with associated ST depression inferiorly.
She was treated with nitroglycerin as well as a heparin drip
and IV beta-blockers and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 2576**] on [**2697-8-19**], for cardiac
catheterization.  This revealed right dominant system with a
tight osteal left main lesion of 80 to 90 percent as well as
90 percent occlusion at the mid LAD.  She had an intra-aortic
balloon pump placed at that time due to her anatomy and the
cardiothoracic surgical consult was obtained.  She was
admitted to the Coronary Care Unit over night and
preoperatively prior to coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glaucoma.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Timolol.

ALLERGIES:  Keflex and Percodan.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies alcohol or tobacco intake
and exercises regularly.

Physical examination preoperatively was unremarkable as were
preoperative laboratory values.

She was taken to the Operating Room on [**2697-8-19**], where
she underwent coronary artery bypass graft times 3 with the
LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein to the OM and saphenous vein
to the diagonal.  Postoperatively, she was transported from
the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in
good condition.  The patient was transported from the
Operating Room on Neo-Synephrine with an intra-aortic balloon
pump intact.  She was successfully weaned from mechanical
ventilation and extubated later the day of surgery.  Her Neo-
Synephrine was weaned off the following day.  Her intra-
aortic balloon pump was discontinued.  She was started on
beta-blocker and transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit
to the Telemetry Floor on postoperative day 1.  On
postoperative day 2, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable in sinus rhythm with a rate in the 80s.  Her chest
tubes were discontinued.  She was begun with diuretics.  On
postoperative day 3, the patient continued to progress from a
physical therapy standpoint.  She began ambulation.  Her
epicardial pacemaker wires were discontinued on postoperative
day 3.  She had not had arrhythmias and was tolerating her
beta-blocker and diuretic regimen.

On postoperative day 4, she continued to progress and
completed physical therapy level 5.  She also had her beta-
blocker increased.  However, the following day on
postoperative day 5, the patient had a syncopal event upon
getting out of the hot shower.  She said that she felt
lightheaded and was helped down to the ground.  She denies
any loss of consciousness and no hitting her head at all.
She was alert and oriented upon examination.  At that time,
she denied any chest pain and was able to stand and ambulate
to bed without any difficulty.  For that reason, her
Lopressor was discontinued and her diuretics were
discontinued as well.  Although her blood pressure was 102/42
at the time of the event and her heart rate was 83 and normal
sinus rhythm, it was felt prudent to decrease her beta-
blocker as well as discontinue her Lasix and keep her in the
hospital for another 24 hours.  She remained monitored for
the following 24 hours with no further events and no further
syncope and no further lightheadedness and is stable and is
being discharged home today.
