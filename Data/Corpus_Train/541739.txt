   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F who presents with nausea, chest tightness found to GNR
   bacteremia, UTI, and possible NSTEMI
   .
   #Gram Neg Rod Bacteremia: Likely source was bladder.  No evidence for
   septic picture, likely from early treatment.
   - Narrowed from cefepime to ceftriaxone.  Will likely need a 14 day
   course from [**9-16**] but can probably go home on PO antibiotics (eg,
   cipro).  Will continue ceftriaxone while in house.  LFTs improving.  No
   evidence of billiary source.
   - D/C stress-dose steroids given stability.  Resume home dose.
   - f/u blood culture speciation
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt likely suffered NSTEMI, her EKG on admission as
   unchanged, however CK peaked 232, MB 20, MBI 6.7.  CK now trending down
   202, MB 9, Trop 0.97. Pt is chest pain free.
   -heparin gtt for 48 hour course complete.
   -Continue asa, statin and plavix
   -start beta-blocker as not at hypotensive risk.
   .
   # PUMP: Pt having acute on chronic systolic HF. Hx of systolic HF with
   EF 20%. Acute on chronic episode may be [**1-8**] NSTEMI.
   -consider IV lasix if o2 sat drops-bp low at this time: currently
   stable
   -ECHO to assess for any changes in systolic function
   .
   # RHYTHM: paced, not anticoagulated for AF
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Urine lytes indicate that this is not
   pre-renal given FeNa of 8%, however may be inaccurate given on lasix at
   home. [**Month (only) 56**] be poor perfusion in setting of heart failure vs renal
   ischemia
   -will cont to follow
   .
   # Diabetes: poorly controlled likely secondary to UTI.
   - cont standing doses of humulin and ISS
   -If sugars continue to be poorly controlled, may need insulin gtt
   .
   # PMR: on steroids at home, will initiate stress dose steroids
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet, no diuretics for now given low bp likely
   [**1-8**] sepsis, monitor and replete lytes
