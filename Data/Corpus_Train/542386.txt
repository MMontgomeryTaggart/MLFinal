   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M with NSTEMI in setting of demand ischemia from GI bleed and
   likely reactive leukocytosis, presenting with renal insufficiency of
   unknown chronicity.
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Patient with 2 day history of dyspnea and chest discomfort.
   EKG shows no ST elevations, no tracing for comparison.  Unknown
   coronary anatomy, ischemia may have been precipitated by anemia, likely
   sec to GI bleed.  Pt received ASA 325mg.  CE trending down.
   - In setting GI bleed, hold on plavix or BB
   -Cont aspirin
   - Cont Atorvastatin 80mg
   - Peinding Lipid panel
   - Likely will need cath.  Will need to discuss with GI whether patient
   is candidate for scope prior to cath.
   .
   # GI Bleed:  Hemodynamically stable.  Unclear if upper or lower.  Guiac
   positive.  s/p 2u PRBCs, HCT did not respond appropriately.  HCT this
   AM 26, patient is likely bleeding.  Patient has had no episodes of
   melena while in CCU.  Recommended transfusing patient as needed.
   -IV Protonix per GI
   -Obtain OSH records of previous EGD/colonoscopy
   - Consult with GI
   - Hold on BB in light of possible GI bleed.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC 17.2, 23.2 yesterday at PCP's office.  Patient
   afebrile.  VSS.  BC pending, U/A negative, Lactate 1.0.
   - Monitor temps, likely reactive.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Unclear baseline.  Improved this AM
   to 1.5.  Likely secondary to poor forward flow. FENA 1.
   - Renally dose meds
   -Monitor Creatinine
   .
   #  Records:  Patient states much of his care is at [**Hospital1 12**].
   - Will obtain records from [**Hospital1 12**].
