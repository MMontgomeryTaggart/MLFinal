TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  Chest pain
   HPI:
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, HTN, SVC stenosis s/p dilation
   presents from HD with acute dyspnea.  She reports malaise the past 5
   days.  In dialysis, she had a low-grade temp of 99, and developed
   chills and respiratory distress with sats 80's on NRB at which time she
   was sent to ED for further evaluation.
   .
   In the ED, VS: T 100.6, HR 117, BP 170/84, RR 38, Sat 90% on NRB.  She
   reported chest pain.  She had evidence of new LBBB with discordant ST
   elevations <5mm in V2-V4. CODE STEMI was called.  She received ASA
   325mg, Plavix 600mg load, heparin bolus+gtt, nitro gtt.  She also
   received 1 gm Vanco for presumed line sepsis.  She was intubated with
   Etomidate and Rocuronium and transferred to the cath lab for
   intervention.
   .
   In the cath lab, she was found to be right dominant with no disease in
   left main.  Serial 90% lesions in LAD with TO at mid LAD.  She has
   left-to-left collaterals.  Minimal disease in circ.  RCA with 30% mid
   occlusion and 90% at origin of PDA.  Lesion in RCA could be crossed
   wire but not ballon due to tortous nature.  CT [**Doctor First Name 438**] was recommended.
   Post-cath, the LBBB was resolved and HR was lower.  LVEDP was elevated
   at 35.  Patient was transferred to the CCU for further monitoring.

   LABS/STUDIES
   EKG:  NSR, rate 96, long PR, wide QRS, LAD, LBBB with discordant ST
   elevations >5mm in V2-V4, Qs in III,avF, TWI in I, avL ( Q's and ST/T
   wave changes new, new LBBB)
   .
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  [**3251-10-30**]
   The left atrium is normal in size. The interatrial septum is
   aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional systolic function is
   normal.  Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.  Aortic stenosis is not
   present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional
   systolic function. Diasatolic dysfunction. Mild-moderate MR. [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 6433**]tic regurgitation.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3249-8-14**], the severity
   of tricuspid regurgitation is reduced. Very mild aortic regurgitation
   and diastolic dysfunction are now identified. The other findings are
   similar.
   .
   CXR: Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, tunneled line in place (my read)
   Overnight events:
   HD removed 1.9 L IVF.
   Seen by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 438**] who recommended pre-op studies in preparation for
   possible CABG (Echo, carotid U/S, blood, urine CX, LFTs, HbA1cs, CEs).
   Bedside ECHO with ok LV function, appears diastolic HF.
   GNR in blood cultures at HD and here.  Started Zosyn.
   EK with STD in V4-6 worsening, TWI in precordial leads.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.
   - C-[**Doctor First Name 438**] evaluation for CABG, but likely will be > 7 days away.
   - Trend CKs to peak
   - continue ASA, statin
   - start ACE-I and bblocker once BP and HR tolerate
   - ck lipid panel for risk reduction with goal LDL < 70
   - resume coumadin as will need bacteremia fully treated prior to
   surgery.
   .
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct. Will not exclude pulmonary
   source of infection given chills and leukocytosis and large A-a
   gradient.  Patient is hypertensive at baseline on metoprolol 150 mg PO
   BID, Losartan 100 mg DAILY, Amlodipine 10 mg, Minoxidil 10 mg PO QAM,
   and Lisinopril 40 mg DAILY at home.  Hypotensive s/p 1.9 L IVF
   removal.  Likely with diastolic dysfunction and preload dependency.
   Given bacteremia, may need generous IVF resuscitation.
   - eval with ECHO today
   - Will support blood pressure with IVF
   - Wean neosynepherin
   - Hold blood pressure lowering medications for now
   .
   RHYTHM: NSR currently, but had 2 episodes of SVT associated with
   hypotension to SBPs of 60.  The episode started with APB, had
   prolonging PR intervals and ended with an atrial pause, with HR around
   150.  Ddx includes A-tach and AVNRT.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - add beta-blockade when pressure tolerates
   .
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient intubated in for acute
   respiratory distress.  Has high FiO2 requirement and large A-a
   gradient.  CXR shows volume overload and possible developing
   infiltrate.
   - Abx with vanc and zosyn for HAP coverage.  Follow sputum culture
   - Fluid goal even, may need to diurese to compensate for obligate IVF.
   - daily CXR
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated, consider increasing PEEP if pressure
   tolerates.
   .
   BACTEREMIA: Chills during HD and low grade temp, along with elevated
   WBC and left count.  Possible sources include pulmonary and skin from
   indwelling HD line.  GNR in blood cultures
   - Vanc/Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures
   - Zosyn to meropenem if worsening for ESBL coverage.  No h/o pip-tazo
   resistance
   - will attempt to treat through bacteremia, but may need to pull line
   if GNR are pseudomonas or other difficult organisms.
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Likely secondary to uremia. Lactate normal
   - HD today
   - monitor lytes
   .
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis
   - goal even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   .
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   .
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.
   - monitor PT/INR
   - restart coumadin with goal [**2-9**], currently subtheraputic, bridge with
   heparin
   .
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   FEN:  NPO, HD today, TF consult
   ACCESS: Peripheral EJ IV and one peripheral IV, HD line, will likely
   need central access.
