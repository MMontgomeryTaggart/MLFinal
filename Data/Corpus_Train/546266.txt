   Assessment and Plan
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial.  Could be [**3-2**] infection with UA
   concerning for UTI.  On cipro, but has been afebrile and without
   leukocytosis.  Other considerations include dehydration given physical
   exam, ARF and increased Torsemide/Valsartan.
   - A line placed
   - Treat UA with IV Cipro
   - Hold Torsemide, Valsartan and Carvedilol
   .
   # ARF on CRI.  CKD baseline Cr 2-2.2.  Worsened during last hospital
   course.  Attributed to starting Torsemide and Valsartan, but discharged
   on these medications despite this.  Hyperkalemia likely attributable to
   worsened renal function.  Likely prerenal, but will send urine studies
   to assess.
   - Urine osms, lytes, sediment
   - Hold Torsemide/Valsartan
   - Continue Sevelamer, check phos, consider d/c if improves
   - Renal diet once diet advanced
   - Consider renal u/s if no improvement
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely [**3-2**] ARF on CRI.  EKG without changes concerning
   for life-threatening hyperkalemia.
   - Repeat electrolytes
   - If continued hyperkalemia, would give kayexelate
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline.  On last admission attributed to his CRI.
   Discharged on ProCrit and iron.  +Guaiac positive in ED.  Would not
   transfuse unless acute drop > 3pt or Hct <21 or e/o end organ ischemia.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCT
   - Guaiac stools
   - Hold iron for ?contribution to AMS
   .
   # Falls: Likely [**3-2**] physical decline given repeat hospitalization, as
   well as possible AMS with UTI, iron, electrolyte abnormalities and
   hypotension.
   - d/c iron
   - treat UTI
   - Give fluid for hypotension
   - PT/OT consults after improvement ?safe to d/c home vs placement
   .
   # UTI: UA positive in ED.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Continue Cipro
   .
   # Type II diabetes mellitus: Hold Glipizide. Monitor on ISS with QID
   FS.
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG in [**3257**]: On ASA, BB. Hold BB for hypotension, will
   restart as able.
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # BPH s/p TURP: On tamsulosin as outpatient.  Foley in place.
   - Hold tamsulosin given hypotenion
   - d/c Foley soon
   - Restart Tamsulosin once improved
   .
   # Sensory deficits: B/L vision loss and hearing loss.  [**Month (only) 47**] worsen AMS
   and contribute to hospital acquired delirium.
   - Orient frequently
   - Discuss with family
   .
   FEN:  Hypovolemic - replete / monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] / NPO while AMS,
   advance to Renal/DM/Heart Healthy diet as improves
   Ppx: Pneumoboots / bowel regimen
