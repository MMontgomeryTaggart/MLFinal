None.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 27008**] is a 24yoF with a PMH of recently diagnosed IDDM
([**2639-5-24**]) who presented with 3 days of fatigue and SOB and found
to be in DKA. She was at a primary care appointment (first visit
with this PMD) on Friday [**5-24**], and was diagnosed with
insulin-dependent diabetes. Her FSG at the visit was 421, per
her report. She stopped her saxagliptin-metformin (Kombiglyze)
which she had been taking since [**2638-11-18**], at that time.

Over the weekend, she began feeling very fatigued, began
urinating very frequently, and was very thirsty. She became so
tired that she was sleeping every few hours. She said she was
drinking the equivalent of about [**2-21**] 12-oz bottles of water. She
also felt burning chest pain which she thought was heartburn,
which she has not had before. She continued to eat until the day
of presentation. She was taking FSGs throughout the weekend in
the morning, before meals, and 2 hours after meals, and all
times it was in the 400s and above.

On the day of presentation, she vomited yellow, watery vomit
twice.  Also, she began feeling SOB on the day of presentation.
She also felt dizzy, which she attributed to not being able to
see too well due to a "white aura" being over her eyes and
because it was too bright for her to see in the sunlight. She
denied feeling sick or having an infection of any kind, denying
fevers/chills, headache, cough, congestion, sore throat, chest
pain, dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

She was diagnosed with diabetes which was thought to be
non-insulin dependent in [**2638-2-16**]. She was 160 lb at the time.
She was started on metformin, which made her feel sick. She was
then transitioned to Januvia, several other medications, and has
most recently been on Kombiglyze. She has lost 52 lbs
unintentionally since [**2638-2-16**], in spite of her doctor's
urging that she "eat more."

Also denies hearing problems, swallowing problems, constipation,
heat/cold intolerance, numbness, tingling, and weakness.

In the ED, FSG 507 and vBG pH 7.00/ pCO2 22 / pO2 62 / base
excess -25. She was found to be tachycardic to the 120s and
breathing at 22 resp/min. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia but no
peaked T waves. She was given 5U IV insulin, started on an
insulin gtt at 5U/hr, and given 4L NS.

Upon admission to the MICU, VS: T 98.5, HR 125, BP 117/91, RR
23, O2sat 99% on RA. On exam she was having Kussmaul
respirations and was tachycardic. She was continued on 5U/hr
insulin, given a 1L NS bolus + 20 mEq, and started on D5 1/2NS +
20 mEq K running at 200cc/hr.

Past Medical History:
Diabetes Mellitus (Dx [**2638-2-16**])

Social History:
She is an MBA student at [**Hospital1 3742**] [**Location (un) 13**]. She lives with Ms.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 248**] while living in [**Location (un) 13**]. Her parents live in [**Location (un) 27009**], NC. She has 2 brothers and 2 sisters. Rare social alcohol
use. She denies tobacco and recreational drug use.

Family History:
Both parents have diabetes. She notes a paternal great
grandmother had a stroke and a great grandfather had a leg
amputation, presumably from diabetes. No other known cardiac or
cancer history.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 27008**] is a 24YOF w/ a PMH of diabetes mellitus who was
found to have a metabolic anion gap acidosis from DKA.

## DKA.  She was admitted w/ FSG 507, vBG pH 7.00/pCO2 22,
bicarbonate <5, Anion Gap 33, and 150 ketones in the urine. Hgb
A1C was found to be 15.2%. Her infectious work-up (CXR, U/A,
BCx, UCx) was unremarkable. She had no signs of cardiac ischemia
on EKG.  She was given 4L NS, 5U IV insulin, and started on an
insulin gtt in the ED. She was admitted to the MICU, upon which
she was tachycardic and having Kussmaul respirations secondary
to her DKA. She was continued on her insulin gtt, given NS bolus
and started on D5 1/2NS + 40 mEq as her FSGs fell to <200. Her
anion gap closed by the morning after her admission, at which
time she was eating as well. She required repletion of several
electrolytes, including Potassium and Phosphate. She was
transitioned from her insulin gtt to SubQ insulin in the evening
after she showed that she could keep good PO and given that
there was some debate about how much SubQ insulin to start her
on since she required 100+ U insulin after about 16 hours of
admission. [**Last Name (un) 156**] was consulted for this, and they determined
that she should be started on 10 U Lantus QS and bridged w/
Humalog.  We bridged her w/ 9 U Humalog, gave the 10 U Lantus
several hours later, and she was able to be taken off of the
insulin gtt. That night, her FSGs remained elevated in the high
200s to 300s, but her anion gap did not re-open. She had her
insulin regimen adjusted by [**Last Name (un) 156**] the next morning, increasing
her Lantus to 13U and her Humalog to 5 U TID. She was able to be
called-out of the MICU given that she was no longer on the
insulin gtt and was hemodynamically stable. She was given
insulin teaching prior to leaving the MICU. On the medicine
floor, her FSG were 100-200's and her insulin regimen was
further titrated per recommendations by [**Last Name (un) 156**].  She tolerated
PO with no problems.  She felt much better, eager to go home,
and was discharged on 15U Lantus qhs and 6U TID Humalog Kwikpen.
 She was observed by nursing to be able to check finger stick
glucose and administer insulin with no problems.

[**Last Name (un) 156**] asked for several labs to be sent off, including
c-peptide, islet cell antibody, insulin antibodies, and glutamic
acid decarboxylase, all of which are still pending at this time.
 She will follow-up with [**Last Name (un) 156**] center for diabetes management
as well as PMD at [**Hospital1 **].

## Acute Renal Failure: She was admitted w/ a Cr. 1.4, and
protein in her urine dipstick. This was likely due to volume
depletion from osmotic diuresis secondary to her DKA, as her Cr
normalized back down to Cr 0.6 by the third day of admission
after volume resuscitation.  Cr 0.5 on day of discharge.

## Leukocytosis: Her WBC was 13.9 on admission. She was afebrile
with no source of infection. This was likely a stress response
due to her DKA, as her WBC normalized over the next few days
without any intervention.   WBC 8.6 on discharge.

## Rectal/vaginal spasms.  Patient reported some intermittent
rectal/vaginal "pressure" or "spasms" started on [**5-29**].  No
dysuria, VB, vaginal discharge, abd. pain, change in BM.  She
does report having had similar spasms in the past but has not
known what they were, thought maybe it was hemorrhoids, however,
no pain/blood with BMs.  Rectal exam performed - no ext.
hemorrhoids, normal tone, no gross blood.  Patient had some
dysuria after foley dc'd on [**5-28**], so UA sent which was normal.
Patient told to follow-up with issue with PMD if continues to be
an issue.

# Anemia.  Noted to have H/H 11.3/32.3 on [**5-29**] from 15.3/46.4 on
admission.  Baseline unknown.  MCV 85, RDW 14.1, anemia possibly
from aggressive fluid resuscitation. Iron studies sent and
patient told to follow-up as outpatient. H/H 11.6/32.8 on
discharge.

## ?Hypothyroidism: TSH was found to be 4.5.  Patient will
follow-up with PMD.

# Patient given follow-up with [**Last Name (un) 156**] Center, PMD, nutrition and
