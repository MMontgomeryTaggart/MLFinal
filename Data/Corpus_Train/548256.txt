   asthma presents to clinic with 2 wks wheezing and dry cough. Note that
   patient is somewhat uncooperative with interview, history is copied
   from admitting team:  She notes that her sx had been slowly
   progressing, but acutely worsened over the past 1-3 days with more SOB.
   Took home albuterol and flovent with some relief. Confirms associated
   fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations (unable to elaborate). Has never
   been hospitalized or intubated for asthma exacerbation. Was seen at
   clinic today, vitals 130/90, 84, 96%, and sent to ED.
   .

   EKG showed inferior Q waves, and diffuse TWI. PIV placed in L EJ as
   unable to obtain other access.
   .
   On floor, pt appears to have SOB, although denies any trouble
   breathing. She states she feels "better." ROS negative for f/c, CP,

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with asthma and MMP p/w wheezing and SOB, with CXR concerning
   for PNA and ARF.
   .
   # Asthma exacerbation: ED noted some improvement with nebs, and pt
   states she is breathing fine, but objectively she appears to have
   labored resps and her air movement is quite poor. She has recv'd 3 nebs
   on the floor, but is still audibly wheezing. Unclear if her mental
   status is at baseline as she is agitated and slow to respond. Pt is
   only mildly acidemic with little to no CO2 retention. This is
   reassuring that she does not need urgent intubation. However, will need
   to monitor her respiratory status closely overnight.
   - IV methylprednisolone 125mg q8h
   -  albuterol nebs q2h , ipratropium q6h. .
   - Supplemental O2 to keep sat > 92. Monitor SpO2 frequently.
   .
   # PNA: Her resp sx are more consistent with obstructive lung disease
   than infection, and her cough is dry, but her CXR demonstrates
   bibasilar infiltrates concerning for PNA. No fever or WBC count,
   although does have elevated polys. Will treat for CAP to cover S.
   pneumo, H. flu, etc. with a 7d abx course.  Has received Azithromycin
   and CTX, but will switch to levofloxacin.
   - Levofloxacin
   .
   # EKG changes: Has h/o MI, inferior Q waves noted on EKG. Now with
   diffuse TWI, new from prior. No CP, but does have palpitations (heart
   racing), some epigastric pain. Trop sent in ER was 0.04, but in
   association with renal disease. She is not clearly demonstrating an
   ischemic picture, but given her hx and multiple risk factors, she will
   be ruled out for MI.
   - Cycle cardiac markers and EKGs.
   - Tele overnight.
   - cont ASA and plavix ,but will hold BB in setting of severe asthma
   exacerbation
   .
   # ARF: No clear etiology. Perhaps prerenal due to dehydration, or her
   CKD may be worsening as her BUN is not elevated from baseline.
   - UA and urine lytes.
   - IVF: 500 cc NS bolus over 60 min, then 3 amp bicarb in D5W at 100
   ml/hr overnight.
   - Follow BUN, Cr.
   - obtain renal U/S
    -renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia: Has been microcytic in the past, takes oral iron, although
   most recent iron studies had normal ferritin. Perhaps due to her kidney
   disease. If remains stable, could have further workup as outpatient.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - Follow up hct in am.
   .
   # DM: Fingerstick on arrival to floor 400. Has some metabolic acidosis,
   but no anion gap.
   - Hold glipizide and cover with humalog sliding scale overnight
   .
   # CAD: Cont ASA, clopidogrel, hold BB
   .
   # HTN: hold metoprolol  for asthma exacerbation
   .
   # Schizoaffective d/o: Cont aripiprazole, citalopram.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont statin
   .
   # FEN: Has nongap acidosis, unchanged from 5 mos prior. Pt without
   diarrhea. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to renal failure.
   - Follow lytes and replete PRN.
   - Cardiac DM diet.
   - Fluids as above.
   .
   # Ppx: Heparin SC
   # Code: full, will confirm with patient
   # Dispo: pending respiratory improvement
