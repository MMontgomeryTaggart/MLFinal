CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   10:35 a
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3249**] with the ICU team today; their note
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that Ms. [**Known patient lastname 3249**] has had
   continued substantial anxiety.  With increased fentanyl, her anxiety
   appeared to decrease, suggesting that pain was a contributor.  She was
   changed to PSV today but had RSBI > 120.  Labs are especially notable
   for a sputum culture with MRSA, INR 3.1, glc 162, There is no CXR from
   today but yesterday
s showed progression of opacities.
   On exam she is alert and follows commands.  Breath sounds are
   diminished, especially at the bases, but there are no wheezes.  Abdomen
   is soft and nontender.  PEG site is intact.
   Assessment and Plan
   54 y/o woman with complicated PMH now with Staphylococcal pneumonia
   (acquired prior to admission) and acute-on-chronic respiratory failure.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Reintubated last night
   emergently after she pulled the tube inadvertantly.  CXR today with
   worsening bilateral interstitial/alveolar infiltrates which could
   represent fluid (noncardiogenic vs. cardiogenic) vs. exacerbation of
   underlying ILD.  Feel infection more likely, need to get better rate
   control and BP contol given known underlying diastolic dysfunction.
   Try diuresis again today.  Continue prednisone for COPD exacerbation.
   Bronchodilators.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP): Gram stain shows
   GNRs, and coag pos staph.  Awaiting final ID/sensitivities. Continue

   albeit also on steroids.

   on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Will decrease coumadin dose and follow
   daily PT.
