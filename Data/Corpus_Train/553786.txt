   Assessment and Plan
 INEFFECTIVE COPING
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   .
   Assessment and Plan: 44 y/o F w. DM, CAD, prior CABG h/o MRSA line
   infections presents from HD with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Increasing concern for line infection.  Given rising WBC
   count, ongoing pressor requirement and tachycardia.  However, no growth
   from cultures to date.  Would repeat surveillance cultures today.  [**Month (only) 56**]
   also be pneumonia although CXR most c/w volume overload.  Reinspect
   wound today for changes although this is unlikely site of infection
   based on initial inspection.  SBP is additional consideration given
   moderate ascites, but in absence of liver disease is very unlikely.
   -Will wean pressors and assess need for BP support by mental status.
   -Consider fluid boluses although appears volume overloaded on exam
   - Pan culture with Blood, sputum (if any), CXR, do not feel tap for SBP
   warranted at this time given exam/history/labs.
   - continue empiric vanco/zosyn for now, narrow at 48 hours if no
   pressor requirement and no culture growth
   - Consider ECHO for interval change in systolic function, tamponade,
   other cardiac cause for hypotension
   - r/o C. Diff
   - Wound culture
   .
   #Volume/ESRD: Renal planning for HD today.  Unclear if she will be able
   to tolerate HD and may need CVVH given hypotension and pressor
   requirement.
   -Total body volume overloaded.
   .
   # Diarrhea: resolved, follow stools.  Given nursing home resident
   taking abx as outpatient would rule out C. Diff infection.
   - c. diff studies
   - guaiac stools.
   .
   # CAD: Continue outpatient medications except BP meds
   - hold lisinopril, atenolol
   .
   # Diabetes: Last A1c was 7.4, erratic glucose control last 24 hours
   with PM hypoglycemia.  Continue sliding scale for now, and dial down PM
   doses as needed for hypoglycemia.
   - Continue insulin regimen.
   - Clarify home doses.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely Anemia of chronic disease due to ESRD, but given
   report of bloody stools, and patient mildly off baseline would guaiac
   stools.  Ferritin 490 in [**Month (only) **] so not likely to be iron deficient
   unless having acute blood loss in stools.
   - Hct stable, continue to trend
   .
   #Psych: Ongoing difficulty with participating in care plan, but able to
   negotiate with patient at this time.  If continues to be refusing care
   would recommend psychiatry involvement for assistance.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin,
   .
   # Access: femoral line placed on night of admission in ED, TDC,
   consider change of TDC if cultures turn positive
