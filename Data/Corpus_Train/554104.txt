   Assessment and Plan
 COMFORT CARE (CMO, COMFORT MEASURES)
 HYPOXEMIA
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
   65 yo Male with metastatic esophageal cancer, chylothorax s/p pleurex
   tube placement, R subclavian & LIJ DVTs on lovenox, p/w worsening
   SOB/edema/weakness, elevated white count, elevated troponins (with flat
   CK), new transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, PE c/w fluid overload, but
   chem-10 suggestive of pre-renal state. Pt with lymphangitic spread, and
   after lone discussion of attending with family and patient, he will be
   CMO.
   .
   1. SOB: Pt has numerous potential reasons for hypoxia such as:
   bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, pulmonary
   edema from CHF given elevated BNP vs. lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
   pneumonia given leukocytosis, PE given hx of numerous DVTs although now
   on lovenox; chylothorax; interstital lung dz s/p chest radiation;
   pericardial effusion.
   - CT of chest without contrast showed increased reticulation of the
   lungs concerning for lymphangitic spread, also signs of metastatic
   disease in liver and abdomen
   - blood culture, sputum culture as high WBC with left shift and current
   presentation suggestive of PNA, however abx were stopped when pt became
   CMO
   -3 Liters drained from pleurex
   .
   2. Elevated troponin: Given that troponin has been rising for 1 day as
   per OSH records and CK has not bumped, this likely does not represent
   infarction. Most likely a troponin spill in response to systemic
   stress. If [**Name (NI) 1845**], pt is already on lovenox. No EKG changes appreciated
   on our or OSH EKGs.
   - holding on further labs for now
   - low suspicion for ACS; will d/c metoprolol
   -lovenox- held
   - hold ASA given thrombocytopenia
   .
   3. Elevated WBC with left shift. Possibly from pneumonia.  will pan
   culture, was on broad abx given recent hospitalization, however stopped
   this AM when became CMO
   - CT chest as above
   - Empiric covg with Vanco/Zosyn for HAP given recent hospitalization
   - Blood Cx, urine Cx, sent on admission
   .
   4. Transaminitis: Not present during last hospitalization. CT showing
   likely liver mets. Elevated transaminitis with elevated alkaline
   phosphatase suggestive of infiltrative process-RUQUS with dopplers
   -will hold on further testing at this time
   .
   5. Thrombocytopenia: Differential includes sepsis, DIC, HIT given
   recent admission with heparin administration. Other possibility
   includes liver failure and diminshed thrmobopoeitin.  Likely from liver
   mets.
   .
   6. Renal Failure: Likely pre-renal given elevated BUN and Creatine,
   with ratio 30:1.  Patient total body fluid overloaded but with low
   albumin is likely intravascularly depleted.
   - holding on further tests
   .
   7.Hyponatremia:Hypervolemic hyponatremia, likely from low albumin, low
   oncotic pressure, decreased effective circulating volume. Secondary to
   lymph involvement of metastatic disease
   .
   8.Hypoalbuminemia: likely from rapidly accumulating chylothoraces with
   albumin leakage.
   .
   FEN: regular diet
   PPX: none, stopped today for comfort
   CMO: Patient and his family discussed their wishes with the attending
   and have decided to be CMO, started morphine gtt, d/c blood draws,
   changed diet to regular. Will try to transfer pt to floor to private
   room.
