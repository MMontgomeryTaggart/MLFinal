   Assessment and Plan
   83 year-old male with MMP including afib on coumadin, CAD,
   cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/pacer, T2DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CKD who
   presents to the ED from rehab with weakness and hypoxia.
   # CHF Exacerbation:   Improving, now on 2L nc.  Had hypoxic yesterday,
   had increasing O2 requirement and was increased to  60% FiO2, desated
   to 80%.  Felt to be fulid overloaded and put out well to iv lasix
   though overall only negative 600cc in 24 hours.  Did not appear gorssly
   fluid overloaded and suspect that hypoxia is primarily due to
   destruction of lung parenchyma [**2-13**] his significant pneumonia.  However,
   BNP of 4700 and likely has  of heart failure
 has depressed EF of ~40%
   per TTE. Received a total of 200ic lasix yesterday and was -1.2L over
   24 hours.
   - no further diuresis as has decreased O2 requirement and Cr bumped to
   2.0
 diurese as needed
   # Multifocal PNA:  CT scan showed worsening of lung process compared to
   the one 2 weeks ago.  Unclear if patient has truly failed PNA treatment
   or if there is another process occurring
 possiblye lung parenchyema
   destruction as a sequalae of his pneumonia.  No culture data available
   .  WBC has normalized at 9.8 today. Other etiologies include BOOP or
   other post-infectious inflammatory process - has peripheral
   eosinophila.  Has hilar nodules on CXR which are likely reactive.
   - no abx for now (got vanc, CTZ, and levo in ED, s/p 10 day course of
   vanc and zosyn,  if spikes or becomes hypotensive, cover broadly with
   vanc and cefipime)
   - f/u cx, blood cx NGTD, urine cx negative, c. diff negative x2
   - continue respiratory support
   # Weakness/Lethargy:   Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 1877**], likley  related to recent
   infectious process, nothing focal on exam
   - work up as above
   # Hypoglycemia:  Resovled. Had low fs at 44 in ED here, got 1 amp D50.
   Likely [**2-13**] to poor po intake and continued home insulin dosing
   - follow fingersticks
   - continue home insulin, ensure good po intake
   - SSI
   # Afib on coumadin: rate controlled currently, INR therapeutic 2.2
   - continue coumadin
   # CAD/cardiomyopathy:  Continue home regimen
   # T2DM:  Insulin as above
   # CKD, Stage III: Cr 2.0 this morning, likely [**2-13**] lasix, baseline is
   1.9
