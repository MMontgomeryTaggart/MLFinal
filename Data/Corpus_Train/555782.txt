Date of service: [**3145-1-19**]
   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Chest pain
   History of present illness: (from Dr.[**Name (NI) 4827**] initial admission note
   and chart) 50 yo male with h/o HCV presented to [**Location (un) **] with chest
   pain; has been having CP for 4 months with activity; but then 2 nights
   ago was moving wood and that produced some severe CP that lasted
   overnight into today; severe, crushing pain, non-radiating, +SOB and
   nausea. He went to [**Location (un) **] ER where he was found to have TropI 67 and
   EKG with q waves inferiorly and signficant R waves V1-V2. He was
   started on aspirin, heparin gtt, nitro gtt and plavix loaded before
   transferring here.
   .
   Per report BP 110/60 but on arrival SBP 80s and tachycardic
   In cath; found LAD chronically occluded (mid) and LCX mid segment had
   thrombus (assumed culprit lesion); tried balloon angioplasty b/c of low
   platelets (didn't want to give stent) but suboptimal results;
   ultimately placed BMS. Could never fully engage RCA; origin may be
   anomalous. Received heparin during procedure (started at OSH). LVEDP
   was elevated but received a lot of dye trying to find RCA.
   .
   After the catheterization, patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1652**]. About 30-60
   minutes after arrival on the floor, he complained of recurrent chest
   pain, nausea, back pain. SBP was initially in the 100s on arrival on
   the floor but then dropped to the 80s then 70s. Patient was given IVF
   bolus. He then vomitted, became unconscious, went into PEA arrest. CPR
   was started. Was given epinephrine 1 mg. Pulses returned. Patient
   regained consciousness, again vomited coffee-ground emesis. Was
   intubated. Started on dopamine and wide-open IVF. Transferred to CCU.
   ECG showed new ST depression in precordial leads and ST elevations in
   II, III. R-sided ECG showed ST elevations in lateral leads.

   Ribavarin; neg viral load per report

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 50 yo male with h/o HCV presented with NSTEMI,
   received BMS in LCx, then had post-cath chest pain, coded, and had new
   evidence of RCA infarct.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt presented with chest pain; found with very signicant
   elevation in Trop and CK at OSH, discovered to have chronically
   occluded LAD and thrombus in LCX; now s/p BMS to LCX. RCA unable to be
   engaged. Pt received Plavix load and aspirin prior. Post-cath chest
   pain and new ECG findings of ST elevations in III>II and precordial ST
   depressions suggest RCA infarct.
   - start bivalirudin bolus and gtt given thrombocytopenia
   - re-activate cath lab; will attempt emergent catheterization again
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel
   - statin in a.m.
   - BB in a.m. if BP tolerates
   - serial ECGs
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - check TTE
   .
   # PUMP: No known h/o diastolic/systolic function, had elevated LVEDP in
   Cath lab. Hypotension likely due to RCA infarct.
   - IVF and dopamine to maintain BP
   - TTE in a.m.
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, currently tachycardic
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 4828**] Pt with plts 57; baseline unknown. Concern given pt
   started on aspirin/plavix but unable to do balloon angiplasty; thus
   requires clopidogrel.
   - monitor CBC closely
   - call PCP in AM to determine baseline (? if related to HCV)
   .
   # Depression:
   - will restart escitalopram once extubated
   .
   # HCV: Pts LFTs not markedly elevated, T.bili at OSH wnl; pt has
   completed IFN/ribavarin and per report recent viral load undetectable.
   - recheck LFTs
   - monitor for signs of esophageal variceal bleed given coffee ground
   emesis
   - monitor CBC closely; transfuse as needed
   .
   # FEN: NPO while intubated, will consider TF
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV's, L fem line (will need to pull non-sterile femoral line
   once stable)
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: Pneumoboots for now (as pt with very low plts) , PPI
   .
   # CODE: Presumed full
   .
   # DISPO: CCU care for now
