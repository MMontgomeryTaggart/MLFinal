   Assessment and Plan
   61F w CAD (s/p CABG), who originally p/w 3 wks of chills/malaise, and
   developed respiratory failure likely [**2-25**] PNA.
   # Respiratory failure: initial concern for ARDS given acute-onset
   hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on chest CT, low CVP. Likely [**2-25**]
   PNA/sepsis, not likely to be [**2-25**] cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CVP is
   low). Question of TRALI given blood transfusion on admission. PCP
   negative, studies sent from mini-BAL, also autoimmune studies to r/o
   vasculitis. CXR with ?new infiltrate.
   - continue ventilatory support; SBT and possible extubation
   - continue current antibiotics; if cx unremarkable, will narrow
   coverage
   - f/u miniBAL studies, cultures
   - f/u CXR read
   - f/u ID and pulmonary recommendations
   # PUMP: On admission, acute systolic CHF exacerbation (LVEF 25-30%) in
   the setting of a-fib and IVF/pRBC infusion. Now resolved with diuresis
   given low CVP. Recent hypotension requiring pressors, but now more
   stable BP off pressors.
   - monitor urine output closely
   - hold off diuresis for now
   # RHYTHM: Patient had 24 hour episode of afib, now in NSR.  She had a
   history of paroxysmal afib previously per patient, but PCP had chosen
   not to anticoagulate for unclear reasons.  She has also been having
   episodes of bigeminy. PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office was [**Name Initial (PRE) 401**] regarding
   anticoagulation.
   - f/u PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue telemetry
   - continue metoprolol
   - keep K > 4.0, Mg > 2.0; replete prn
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG
   - continue clopidogrel, ASA, and statin
   - continue metoprolol
   - will hold ACEi in the setting of acute renal failure
   # Acute renal failure: Cr on admission 1.5 with elevated BUN. In the
   setting of 3 wk of fever and poor po intake, this is most likely
   prerenal (FEBUN 26%).  Cr now back to normal, 0.8.
   - monitor renal labs, urine output
   - restart ACEI
   # Anemia: Patient with a history of pernicious anemia on b12 injections
   and additionally is on iron as an outpatient. On admission had Hct of
   23 got 1 unit of pRBCs. Unlikely hemolysing or acutely bleeding given
   elevated haptoglobin, normal bilirubin. Anemia labs with iron 11 (low),
   TIBC 229 (low), B12 > assay, folate > assay, haptoglobin 360
   (elevated), ferritin 1063 (high) transferrin 176 (elevated). Given
   markedly elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic disease.  Hct
   bumped appropriately after 1 unit of pRBCs.
   - monitor CBC closely
   - cont outpatient iron, outpatient weekly b12 shots
   - guaiac stool (no BM yet)
   .
   # Hypernatremia: sodium elevated today, water deficit of 1.7L
   - continue D5W
   - monitor lytes
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN/GI: intubated, replete lytes PRN, PPI
   .
   # ACCESS: Right IJ, Left radial a-line, PIV; consider removing IJ if
   still improving tomorrow
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: iv heparin, ppi, colace, senna
   .
   # CODE: full
   .
   # DISPO: CCU care for now
