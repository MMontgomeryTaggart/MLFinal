   Assessment and Plan
   65M with presumed EtOH cirrhosis transferred from OSH for management of
   dyspnea and expedited workup for consideration of combined liver -
   kidney transplant
   .
   #Respiratory distress: Intubated urgently in setting of desaturations.
    Possibilities include worsening of hydrothorax, pneumonia or
   aspiration pneumonitis.  At this point not febrile. CXR shows worsening
   of right opacification.
   -follow sputum cx
   -Repeat CXR
   -f/u OSH thoracentesis results
   .
   #MRSA bacteremia: Vanco during HD, to complete 14-day course on
   [**3387-1-20**]. Discontinued ceftriaxone as no evidence of ongoing gram
   negative infection based on culture data.
   - Repeat surveillance cultures daily to ensure clearance
   - Echocardiogram, TTE to assess for vegetations
   .
   # Altered mental status: likely hepatic encephalopathy and worsening in
   setting of sepsis
   -continue antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia, hold on further abx and dose
   according to fevers or other signs of infection
   -lactulose titrated to [**2-27**] BM/day
   -consider rifaximin if no improvement in [**12-28**] days with above
   .
   # ESLD: Most recent MELD 28 on [**3387-12-11**].
   -pretransplant work up
   -HBV, HCV, EBV, Toxo, CMV, VZV, MMR, RPR, HIV all done on [**3387-12-11**].
   - Will need Hep B and Hep A vaccinations, can consider starting while
   in house
   - Ordered for echocardiogram to assess for pulmonary hypertension and
   re-assess reported inferior and anterolateral wall motion abnormalities
   at OSH.
   - ? TIPS candidate for recurrent hepatic hydrothorax
   - Restarted furosemide/spironolactone and nadolol since blood pressure
   stable here.
   .
   # Renal failure: Due to ATN following surgery in [**11-2**].
   - Dialysis team notified
   -Consult renal transplant for consideration of liver/kidney listing
   -continue HD
   -Renagel, nephrocaps
   .
   # FEN: History of recent weight loss (165->146 in [**Month (only) 1121**]; will repeat
   today); with anorexia and poor po intake.
   -regular diet
   -nutrition consult with calorie counts; consideration of Dobhoff/tube
   feeds if not at goal
   -follow lytes
   # Access: PIV
   # PPX: ambulating, lactulose, PPI, nadolol
   # Dispo: pending
