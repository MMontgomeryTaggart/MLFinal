   who is here with a CHF exacerbation now on a milrinone drip.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient did well on the milrinone gtt and lasix gtt yesterday - put out
   over 3 L.  The patient was continued on the milrinone and lasix gtts
   for another day.  His dig level returned at 1.8 and he is now on 0.125
   of dig every other day.  His LOS fluid balance this am was negative 6.7
   L.
   The patient had episodes of apnea overnight where he would not breathe
   for up to 15 sec, however his oxygen saturation generally remained
   normal.  This am he denies CP, SOB, or recent dizziness.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo M with CAD, CHF (EF 25-30%), afib, s/p ICD pacer who presents
   with LE edema after multiple prior admission, transferred to CCU after
   becoming hypotensive and having confusion with IV Lasix boluses.
   Getting Milrinone and Lasix gtts.
   #. CHF with both systolic and diastolic failure, EF 20%, poor response
   to both preload and afterload changes. did not respond to iv lasix and
   then dropped bp to lasix drip.  On Milrinone, increased overnight to
   0.625 mcg/kg/min.  On lasix gtt.  Patient was 1.8 L negative yesterday
   and 6.7 L negative for LOS.  The patient has completed his digoxin
   loading and had a dig level of 1.8 yesterday; no dig dose was given
   yesterday given his renal failure.
   - daily i&os, low na diet
   - daily weight, 1200 fluid restriction
   - Will stop his milrinone and lasix gtt after confirming with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   as he has reached his goal of almost 7 L negative and his Cr has
   started to increase likely secondary to intravascular volume
   depletion.  Will discuss starting a po lasix dose once his drips are
   stopped.
   - will decrease his digoxin dosing to 0.0625 every other day given his
   rising Cr and check a level t/m
   - continue Toprol XL 25 PO qday, Lisinopril 2.5mg PO qday
   #. Acute renal failure:  The patient
s Cr increased to 2.0 from 1.7
   likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion from his diuresis.
   His baseline is in the 1.7-1.8 more recently, but had been 1.3-1.4
   within the last year.
   - Will likely stop aggressive diuresis as above and continue to
   monitor.
   #. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a h/o CAD. He is not
   currently having any symptoms of chest pain.
   - Continue home dose of Metoprolol, NTG, Simvastatin, aspirin
   #. Gout: Patient has a history of gout. He currently takes Allopurinol
   300 mg daily at home. Given the patient's renal function, this dose was
   changed to Allopurinol 100 mg daily.
   - Continue lower dose of Allopurinol given ARF.
   #. GERD: Patient
s home dose of ranitidine was decreased due to his
   decreased renal function to 150 mg daily.
   #. FEN: Heart-healthy, low sodium, 1200 cc fluid restriction diet.
   Replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   #. Access: PIV
   .
   #. PPx:
   - DVT: Heparin SQ
   - GI: Colace and Senna daily
   - Pain: Tylenol prn
   .
   #. Code: DNR/DNI (confirmed with patient and health care proxy)
   .
   #. Dispo: Patient can be called out to the floor today.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Upon discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], it was decided to pursue another day of
   diuresis as the patient has continued edema in his upper thighs.  Will
   continue the milrinone and lasix gtts (increasing lasix gtt back up to
   5 mg/hr)  with a goal of 2 L negative for today.  Will check pm lytes.
