   HPI: 79 year-old man who was confused at breakfast, difficulty
   getting up from a seated position at 11:30am, RIGHT facial droop and
   now presents as a transfer from [**Hospital 222**] Hospital for management of a
   left thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension. Brainstem
   reflexes are largely absent at this time (with the exception of perhaps
   minimally reactive pupils and a gag reflex). Suggestive of a
   hypertensive hemorrhage.  At end of [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 52**] patient
   reportedly "lost his airway" upon landing on the roof, and was
   intubated. Patient takes aspirin and plavix at home, coags wnl.
