Chief Complaint:  DKA
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 749**] is a 38 y/o woman with PMH notable for type I DM (since age
   6), PVD s/p L BKA ([**2525**]) admitted from the VICU with diabetic
   ketoacidosis. The patient originally presented to the vascular lab this
   morning for planned angiogram of the right leg due to dry gangrene of
   right 1st and 3rd toes. The patient was told not to take her insulin
   the morning of her procedure and she was NPO. On arrival to the
   procedure, the patient had a critically high fingerstick; labs taken at
   830 am demonstrated a blood glucose of 994. Of note, she was recently
   admitted [**Date range (1) 4370**] due to hyperglycemia and PVD/dry gangrene of
   the right foot as above. At that time, she was discharged to home for
   outpatient workup of her PVD. She contact[**Name (NI) **] her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 654**], for
   expedited workup and angiogram was planned for today.
   .
   This morning, she underwent angiography of her right leg (sheath placed
   in left leg and she received 110 cc of contrast. The site was closed
   with perclose at the end of the procedure (1030 am). During the
   procedure, she was given 16 U of regular insulin and started on an
   insulin drip at 10 U an hour at 1055 am.
   .
   On the floor, the patient's vitals were T 96.3 HR 90 BP 114/70 RR 16
   POx 100% on RA. ABG was 7.15 / 33 / 126. She was then transferred to
   the ICU for further management of DKA. On arrival to the ICU, the
   patient is complaining of "total body" pain, mainly in her arms and
   legs. She also is complaining of pain in the left groin. She states
   that her pain is due to "all the procedures she's had this morning."
   She has usual phantom limb pain for which she takes one percocet daily.
   She also takes gabapentin three time per day. She denies any recent
   fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, or shortness of
   breath. Her sugars have been running 200-300 and she has been taking
   her insulin regularly with the exception of this am.  She at dinner
   normally last night (tuna casserole).

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 749**] is a 38 y/o woman with DMI, PVD s/p left BKA and dry gangrene
   of 1st and 3rd digits of the foot presenting in transfer from [**Hospital Ward Name 278**] 5
   VICU with DKA after right leg angiogram.
   .
   # Diabetic ketoacidosis - Seems to be secondary to missing AM insulin,
   D51/2NS given during procedure, and stress of the procedure. Serum
   acetone is positive and positive ketones in urine. Fingersticks on
   arrival this morning were greater than assay on the glucometer. AG now
   25, repeat lytes pending.
   - NS at 150 cc/hour (already received 1 L bolus on floor)
   - fingersticks q1h
   - insulin gtt
   - d/c D51/2ns for now (replaced with NS)
   - Electrolytes q4h with repletion of potassium, calcium, and magnesium
   - [**Last Name (un) 292**] consult
   - will d/c insulin gtt when gap closes & start SC insulin
   - plan to start D5 once glucose < 200
   - repeat ABG now, start bicarb fluids if pH < 7.00
   .
   # PVD w/ dry gangrene of 1st/3rd digits of right? foot - Vascular aware
   of patient and would like to proceed with femoral-popliteal bypass,
   hopefully during this admission.
   - check venous doppler for mapping. Patient told primary floor team
   that she would like to hold off on surgical intervention until after
   [**Holiday 4371**].
   - f/u final vascular recommendations, arrange surgical date/time for
   hopefully this admission if patient agreeable
   - continue ASA, statin
   .
   # Acute renal insufficiency: Creatinine up to 1.5 from baseline 0.9-1.
   Will continue to trend.
   - fluids as above
   - hold ACEi
   - consider mucomyst
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely pseudohyponatremia given blood sugar > 700.
   Corrects to approximately 139 for glucose at the time. Continue to
   trend.
   .
   # Pain: Complaining of "all over" body pain on arrival to MICU.
   - morphine 2 mg IV X 1
   - tylenol & oxycodone by mouth, monitor for sedation
   - continue gabapentin, appropriately dosed for renal function currently
   .
   # Recent NSTEMI: Continue aspirin, statin, beta blocker. No concerning
   EKG changes currently.
   .
   # hypertension: Continue home meds with exception of ACEi. Will change
   toprol XL to [**Hospital1 **] lopressor for easier titration.
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, sips for now and advance
   diet as tolerated
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, ppi per home regimen, bowel meds
   prn

   Critical Care
   Present for key portions of history and exam. Agree with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   assessment and plan as outlined above.  DKA precipitated apparently by
   withholding insulin in preparation for angiogram.  Her BS has come down
   nicely on insulin gtt and her gap has closed. She has no nausea and is
   hungry so we are converting to sq insulin after feeding her.  Gtt now
   off.  Well hydrated for dye load but no NaHCo3 or Mucomyst. Urine
   output remains good and creat is relatively normal.
   Time spent 40 min
