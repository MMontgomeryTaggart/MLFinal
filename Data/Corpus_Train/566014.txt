   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with PMHx of Severe COPD, Diastolic Dysfunction and AVJ
   ablation s/p PCM who presents with BRBPP, Hct of 13 and
   supratherapeutic INR at 21.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Pt presenting with 3-4 days of dark stools and BRBPR.
   Found to have hct drop to 13 and still HD stable which suggests that
   this must have been slow bleed with compensation.  Unclear source, may
   be bleeding from more than one site. Given gross coagulopathy with INR
   of 21, unsafe for NG tube or urgent EGD per GI.  Will aggressively
   resuscitate with blood & FFP overnight, t/b with GI if any signs of
   recurrent melena.
   - received 5 units PRBCs and 3 units FFP with only modest increase in
   HCT
   - maintain > 4units crossmatched
   - f/u q4hr hct
   - Cipro 400mg IV BID for PPx (possible UGI source)
   - NPO with protonix gtt at 8mg/hr
   - octreotide 50mcg bolus and gtt at 50mcg/hr
   - f/u GI recs
   - correct coagulopathy as below
   - maintain PIV & CVL
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Pt on coumadin as outpt and last INR was 1.8 on [**2-28**]^th. He has been maintained on a stable regimen of 1 or 1.5mg per day
   and now found to have INR>21 for unclear reasons. He completed a course
   of Abx in early [**Month (only) **] for H. Pylori and he was recently treated with
   Prednisone for gout flare.  Otherwise, no recent med changes, does
   report poor po intake.  Pt denies mucosal bleeding, hematuria and
   hemoptysis.  Received Vitamin K 10mg IV and 1u FFP prior to transfer
   - continue Vitamin K 5mg po x 3days
   - FFP PRN
   - f/u INR
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Pt with cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly & portal HTN seen
   on RUQ u/s performed in [**10-19**].  Pt is unaware of this diagnosis and does
   not appear to have had any workup in the past.  EGD from 07 did not
   show any varices, but may have developed portal gastropathy in the
   interim.
   - f/u iron studies
   - f/u hepatitis panel, [**Doctor First Name 1168**], [**Last Name (un) 5763**], AMA
   - f/u liver consult recs
   .
   # Diastolic Dysfunction: Pt with known diastolic dysfunction presenting
   with significant hct drop and GI bleed, now being aggressively
   resuscitated with blood products.  Concern for volume overload/pulm
   edema with resuscitation
   - lasix 40mg IV with every 2-3units of products
   - holding BP meds given marginal BPs and hypovolemia
   - monitor resp status, CPAP overnight
   .
   # ARF: Baseline creatinine of approx 1.8 and now 2.3 with BUN of 80.
   Pt is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia from blood loss.  Elevated
   BUN may also be due to upper GI bleed.  Will aggressively resuscitate
   with blood products and recheck lytes in am.
   - transfuse as above
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - foley in place
   - f/u am labs and send urine lytes if not improving
   .
   # Afib s/p AVJ ablation & PCM: holding coumadin given INR>21 and active
   GI bleed
   - hold nodal agents given hypovolemia and bleed
   .
   # OSA: Pt with OSA, restrictive PFTs and severe pulm HTN.
   - continue home CPAP settings overnight
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now
   - replete electrolytes aggressively
   .
