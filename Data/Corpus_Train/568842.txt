Chief Complaint:  OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3671**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3672**] and Dr.
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 464**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3673**]
   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Referred for cath due to DOE/abnl stress now with
   elevated PCWP, balloon pump and 3VD.
   HPI:
   Pt is a 72F with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and COPD.
   She was seen in cardiac consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3672**] on [**10-1**] for
   complaints of shortness of breath. She underwent an echocardiogram
   which revealed segmental wall abnormalities.  She then underwent a
   nuclear stress test which was limited by functional capacity and
   shortness of breath.  Nuclear images did reveal multiple perfusion
   defects involving the anterior wall, apex and part of the inferior
   wall.  Pt reports developing increasing DOE over past year, reports she
   is able to walk one block and climb one flight of stairs "slowly" but
   without stopping. Can carry her groceries.  Denies ever having
   experienced any chest discomfort. Otherwise on ROS: Denies orthopnea,
   LE edema.  No HA, vision changes, dysphagia, palpitations, heart burn,
   abd pain, n/v/d/c, musculoskeletal pain.
   She has been worked up extensively by pulmonary and found to have
   COPD.  Apparently she has never smoked but worked for thirty years in a
   factory with exposure to fiberglass on a
   daily basis.  She was started on multiple inhalers and was doing well
   until this past fall when she developed a cold.  She was given
   antibiotics and steroids which resolved her cold but she
   noticed that since that time she develops shortness of breath with
   exertion.  She reports the episodes are inconsistent, some days she can
   walk the length of the grocery store without
   difficulty but other days she develops shortness of breath after one
   block.  She denies chest discomfort, dizziness, lightheadedness,
   nausea, near syncope, or syncope.
   Pt underwent cardiac catheterization on day of admission to the CCU.
   She was found on right heart cath to have markedly elevated RA, PASP
   and PCWP pressures, with a mean wedge pressure ~40. On L heart cath had
   occluded LAD, tight LM lesion, as well as tight lesions in proximal RCA
   and PDA.  Given nitro gtt for HTN, 40mg IV lasix x 2, IABP placed.
   Heparin gtt started. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 618**] evaluated the pt in the lab for
   anticipated CABG this admission.

   dilated with normal free wall contractility. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

   -Vasodilation with NTG, consider adding hydral prn and uptitrating as
   tolerated
   -holding ACEI for now with cr 1.3 and pre-CABG
   # RHYTHM:  NSR. Monitor on tele
   -BB
   # HTN:
   -Continue BB, switch from atenolol to metoprolol tartrate for ease of
   titration and in setting of possible worsening renal function.
   -NTG gtt
   -consider hydral for afterload reduction
   -holding home verapamil for now
   -Hold ACEI in setting of dye load, cr 1.3 and pre-CABG as above.
   # COPD
   -Standing ipratropium nebs
   -Prn albuterol nebs

   # Hyperlipidemia. Pt carries dx of elevated lipids, on recent PCP labs,
   LDL low at 62, low HDL 33.  Has been on fibrate therapy for "years" for
   unclear reasons.  In setting of low HDL, and for peri-operative med
   optimization will start low dose statin.

   -repeat lipids
   # Depression - Continue home dose fluoxetine, 20mg TID confirmed with

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this [**3104-12-23**], I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans as well as those detailed in Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 3618**]
s note from [**3104-12-23**].
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 1366**].
   I would add the following remarks:  Planning CABG for severe CAD.
   Remains on IABP necessitating critical care.  Continue diuresis.
   Critical Care time 60 minutes.
