Chief Complaint:  admission s/p tpa infusion with thrombectomy
   HPI:
   66 y/o F with PMHx of advanced endometrial stromal tumor, s/p
   hysterectomy complicated by extensive DVT and PE.  Pt was put on
   Lovenox and had IVC filter placed [**2939-12-22**], and underwent further ex-
   lap on [**2938-12-29**].  Pt was found to have iliac vein thrombus that extends
   from the level IVC filter to common iliac vein on left and and external
   iliac on the right. Pt was taken for elective IR thrombolysis and
   thrombectomy with local tPA infusion. Pt tolerated the procedure well
   but developped lower back pain that she felt was related to lying flat
   on the procedure table for >4hrs.  She reports that she has developped
   a similar pain in the past that she relates to her osteopenia.  Pt was
   admitted for overnight monitoring post tPA infusion.  Per IR report,
   thrombectomy was unsuccessful and there is no need for continued tPA or
   repeat venogram in the am.
   .
   On arrival to the CCU, pt was describing nausea and [**3-10**] lower back
   pain that improved with dilaudid. She denies CP, palpitations, HA, abd
   pain, lower extremity pain/weakness.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o F with PMHx of advanced endometrial stromal tumor s/p
   hysterectomy complicated by extensive DVT/PE who underwent elective
   thrombectomy with tPA today.
   .
   # DVT/thrombectomy/tPA: Pt with extensive DVT who was admitted to ICU
   for monitoring s/p failed thrombectomy with attempted tPA infusion. Pt
   developped lower back pain during procedure that she reports is similar
   to prior MSK pain.  Abd exam benign though c/o nausesa currently.  Hct
   unchanged and hemodynamically stable, low suspician for RP bleed, but
   will monitor closely o/n given need for ongoing anti-coagulation and
   tPA today.
   - f/u q6hr hct
   - monitor BP continuously in ICU
   - venous fem catheter removed, monitor groin sites
   - monitor for HA, abd/back pain & CT scan prn
   - f/u am IR recs
   - continue Lovenox 60mg sc BID
   - dilaudid 0.25mg IV q4hr prn severe pain
   - f/u am fibrinogen after tPA per IR
   .
   # Nausea: Pt with mild nausea and non-bloody emesis, most likely due to
   pain meds.  However, will  monitor closely for e/o RP bleed.
   - ativan, benadryl, zofran prn
   - monitor for abd pain & consider CT for RP bleed if hct drop
   .
   # ARF: baseline creatinine 1.0, currently elevated at 1.3 after being
   NPO for almost 24hrs.  Suspect pre-renal, will challenge with 1L of NS
   IVF overnight
   - NS 1L IVF o/n
   - f/u am labs
   .
   # Endometrial Stromal Ca: followed closely by Onc/Ob/Gyn
   - f/u with hem/onc as outpt
   - continue Megace per outpt regimen & lovenox 60mg sc BID
   .
   # FEN: Regular diet with MIV, no IVF
   - replete lytes prn

   ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   Key Points:
     * In IR today for attempted thrombectomy, which was not done.
       Hemodynamically stable and hct stable. Repeat hct in 6 hrs, then in
       AM.
     * ARF, probably prerenal. Had been NPO, will give fluids and start
       diet.
