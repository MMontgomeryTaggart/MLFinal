SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in Senior Housing with
close following by his daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation to the Vascular
Surgery service, temperature was 98.0, pulse 62, respiratory
rate 18, blood pressure 140/70, oxygen saturation 98% in room
air.  In general, the patient is an alert and cooperative
white male in no apparent distress.  Skin is warm and dry.
Eyes - Sclera anicteric.  The pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  Pulses - 2+ radial bilateral pulses, 1+ right
femoral pulse, left femoral pulse weakly dopplerable. Chest
is clear to auscultation bilaterally with diffuse wheezes.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Left stump site
was erythematous with no drainage and nontender. Right venous
stasis changes with no ulcerations.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 6.8,
hematocrit 30.0, platelets 212,000.  Sodium 142, potassium
5.1, chloride 102, bicarbonate 30, blood urea nitrogen 69,
creatinine 2.1, glucose 124.  INR was 1.0.

Chest x-ray revealed left ventricle decompensation without
overt signs of congestive heart failure.  Ultrasound of the
left lower extremity revealed cellulitis of the left below
the knee amputation stump with no drainable fluid collection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Vascular
Surgery service for management of presumed stump infection.
He was treated with Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  He had an
ultrasound to rule out fluid collection as described above.
This was determined not to be surgically debridable.  During
the course of the patient's admission on the Vascular Surgery
service, routine laboratories revealed that the patient was
suffering from acute on chronic renal failure.  Additionally,
a routine electrocardiogram revealed new onset left bundle
branch block.  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction by serial CKs and the patient did complain of
primarily exertional chest pain.

On [**3094-4-18**], the patient was transferred to the Medical
service for further evaluation of chest pain and renal
failure.  Additional data prior to transfer to the Medical
service, electrocardiogram revealed 70 beats per minute, wide
complex regular sinus, left bundle branch block which was new
from baseline electrocardiogram in [**3089**].  The PR interval was
within normal limits.

MEDICAL SERVICE HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Infectious disease - For the patient's cellulitis, he was
continued on Levaquin and Flagyl.  These were renally dosed.
He will complete a total fourteen day course of this
antibiotic.  The cellulitis did resolve over the course of
his time on the Medical service and the patient remained
afebrile.

2.  Cardiovascular - On [**3094-4-19**], the patient was taken to
cardiac catheterization to evaluate for his rest anginal
pain.  He was maintained on a Heparin drip prior to this and
was given Mucomyst to prophylax against renal damage.
Cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel disease and he
received no intervention.

3.  The patient was seen in consultation by the cardiac
surgery service who felt that the patient was not a surgical
candidate.  In light of this information, the patient
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with the intention
of high risk intervention.  This cardiac catheterization
revealed left main and three vessel coronary disease as
determined on the prior catheterization with severe systolic
ventricular dysfunction and successful left main coronary
artery stenting and OM1 stenting with rescue percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the AV groove circumflex
artery.

Given the high risk nature of the patient's intervention, he
was maintained on an intra-aortic balloon pump and was
admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for overnight observation.
He then returned to the Medical service following this
catheterization and CCU stay, he has since had no further
episodes of chest pain.  Cardiac medications included a beta
blocker.  The patient's Lasix was held because of renal
function described below.

4.  Renal - For the patient's acute on chronic renal failure,
he was seen in consultation by the renal service and was felt
to have acute on chronic renal failure likely secondary to
worsening diabetic nephropathy and likely renal artery
vascular disease.  In order to treat this renal artery
vascular disease, the patient underwent left renal
angioplasty during the cardiac catheterization on [**3094-4-19**].
The left renal artery was stented as well.  Following this
procedure, the patient's creatinine remained stable.
However, over the course of [**3094-4-22**], to [**3094-4-23**], the
patient's creatinine began to rise and it was felt that the
patient likely had acute tubular necrosis secondary to the
two dye loads he had received during the two cardiac
catheterizations.  The patient became anuric and was followed
by the renal service.  The renal service recommended that the
patient be started on hemodialysis and that the prognosis for
recovery of renal function is borderline to unlikely.  On
[**3094-4-24**], a permacath was placed using a tunneled fashion.
The patient started on hemodialysis on [**3094-4-24**], and
[**3094-4-25**].  His electrolytes remained stable with
hemodialysis.

5.  Hematologic - The patient's hematocrit was generally
stable throughout the admission, however, on [**3094-4-22**], the
patient's hematocrit dropped approximately ten points to a
low of 20.0.  The patient was hemodynamically stable during
this and asymptomatic.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
were negative for bleeding.  No source was identified,
however, the patient's hematocrit rose appropriately after
two units of packed red blood cells and remained stable
thereafter.  Once started on hemodialysis, the patient
received Epogen during dialysis.

6.  Musculoskeletal - A right knee effusion was appreciated
and confirmed by ultrasound.  The patient underwent
arthrocentesis on [**3094-4-23**].  Results of fluid analysis were
consistent with osteoarthritis with no crystals and less than
300 white blood cells.  Gram stain was negative.  Culture was
negative.  The patient had relief of some of his knee pain
following this but the effusion was felt to have
reaccumulated at the time of this dictation.

7.  Endocrine - The patient was managed with regular insulin
sliding scale and NPH insulin.  He had stable blood glucoses
during the admission.

8.  Additional laboratory studies during this admission - CT
abdomen with contrast and CT pelvis without contrast
[**3094-4-22**], looking for signs of bleeding revealed no evidence
for retroperitoneal hematoma, bulky inguinal lymphadenopathy
of uncertain clinical significance, small bilateral fat
containing inguinal hernia, bilateral small effusions,
greater on the left than the right, and atrophic appearing
kidneys which demonstrated patchy areas of delayed
enhancement felt to be possibly consistent with multifocal
renal infarction.  Renal ultrasound performed on [**3094-4-23**],
revealed no hydronephrosis.  Femoral ultrasound performed on
[**3094-4-22**], looking for femoral pseudoaneurysm, status post
cardiac catheterization, revealed no pseudoaneurysm.

The patient's creatinine peaked at 7.7 on [**3094-4-24**], prior to
institution of hemodialysis.  The patient's lowest hematocrit
was 20.7 on [**3094-4-22**].

A list of discharge diagnoses, follow-up instructions,
discharge instructions and discharge medications will be
dictated at a later date by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
