Chief Complaint:  fever, hypotension
   HPI:
   Pt is a 51 y/o M hx HIV (last CD4 1080 [**12-16**]), OSA, s/p splenectomy now
   presents with fever and rigors. He had been in good health until 4:45
   this AM when he woke suddenly with rigors, chills, and temp to 101.9,
   Prior to this, he had been feeling well for the past few weeks except
   for very mild R flank tenderness the day prior to admission. No sick
   contacts, although he does work at [**Name (NI) 1011**] and sees pts, no travel. He
   called EMS, temp at that time was 101, and was brought to [**Hospital1 **] ED.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: T P BP R O2 sat. His SBP rapidly decreased
   to 60's with MAPs 40's and he received 7L NS. He was started on neo,
   then + levophed with SBP in the 80-90's. Vanc/Cefepime/Azithro/Tamiflu
   given. He also recieved decadron 10 mg IV X 1, tylenol, motrin Mixed
   venous O2 82-86. With aggressive fluids, he became more SOB with
   increasing Oxygen requirements to 90% on 5L NC and was placed on NRB
   with sats 98% and RR 30's. CT abd negative for acute intraabdominal
   pathology.
   .
   On the floor, he is feeling weak, but slightly better. ROS is positive
   for mild flank pain, but currently resolved. he did have an arm scratch
   which bled several days ago, but no dental abscess, toothache, cough,
   GI symptoms, dysuria or other sources for infection. He did received
   pneumovax and flu shot.
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 51 y/o M hx HIV (last CD4 1080 [**12-16**]) now
   presents with fever, hypotension requiring pressors and GPC septic
   shock
   .
   # Septic Shock: His hypotension and positive blood cx (GPCs in
   pairs)are consistent with septic shock. Of note, he is asplenic and at
   high risk for encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae,
   Haemophilus influenza, and Neisseria meningitidis. Given very high
   fever, there was some concern for flu. No clinical signs to suggest
   cardiogenic shock. Also, not adrenally insufficient as cortisol is 38.
   - goal CVP>[**9-18**], MAP>65, mixed venous >70
   - trend lactate
   - goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - check LFTs given hypotension
   - continue levophed and neo and titrate to above parameters
   - if persistantly needs pressors, would add on vasopressin and
   preferentially wean down neo
   - f/u blood cx speciation and continue Vanc/Cefepime for broad coverage
   - urine/sputum cx, rapid viral screen in ED
   - consider ID consult (ID care at OSH)
   - current mental status is good, but if altered, would have low
   threshold for LP
   - echo to look for vegetations
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: CXR with no clear infiltrate, and by ED
   report, he only became SOB and hypoxic after aggressive fluid
   [**Last Name (LF) 5584**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] I suspect volume overload. No echo in OMR. he does
   have OSA with central and obstructive.
   - continue NRB and low threshold for intubation for resp failure
   - at this point, priority of treatment of septic physiology
   - echo as above
   .
   # Rash: he has a blanching erythematous macular rash over enitre back.
   Per pt, was initially full body in ED, but has since improved
   - continue to monitor for drug rash
   .
   # HIV: Currently not on HAART and CD4 count is 1080, so no need for
   ppx.
   - touch base with outpt
   .
   # OSA:
   - continue home CPAP
   .
   # FEN:
   - IVF as above
   - replete electrolytes
   - NPO for now
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - Subcutaneous heparin
   - PPI
