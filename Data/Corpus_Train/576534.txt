   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo M with h/o etoh cirrhosis admitted with recent vomiting and now
   unresponsiveness.  Found to be in renal failure with hyperammonemia.
   Altered mental status:  Much better today.  Putting picture together,
   seems most c/w hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of recent increase
   in vomiting and dehydration and respiratory alkalosis
     -Continue Lactulose and rifaximin
    Renal Failure: Prerenal from dehydration vs HRS.  Both GFR and
   potassium have improved with hydration.
   ?GIB:  Some blood in his mouth and per partner some hematemesis
   recently.  No signs of active bleeding, HCT stable.
     -PPI and carafate
     -Possible EGD at some point in the future.
    Cirrhosis:
     -Lactulose and rifaximin as above
     -Diuretics on hold in setting of dehydration
    Etoh abuse:  Should be out of the window for withdrawal at this point.
     -Vitamin Support
     -Addiction consult
   FEN: Will po challenge today as he removed his NGT.
      -If needed, will use D5 1/2 NS for maintence given hyperchloremic
   non-gap acidosis.
