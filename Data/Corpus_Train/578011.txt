   Assessment and Plan
   78yo F with no past medical history transferred from OSH after having
   NSTEMI in setting of hip fracture from mechanical fall.
   Left hip fracture: patient had ORIF of left hip yesterday. Currently
   pain free.
   - Will manage pain, cautious with narcotics
   - sub q hep for dvt prophylaxis
   - Monitor pulses, edema, hct to ensure no bleed into joint
   - orthopedics recs
   - [**Name (NI) 2932**], PT, dsg will be changed POD#2 (Sunday) by ortho
   NSTEMI: elevated troponin, had cardiac catherization showing mild
   nonobstructive disease. Possibly autolysed lesion, or had coronary
   spasm peri-fall or may have had takotsubo with hip fracture. EF 45%
   - Aspirin decreased from 325mg to 81mg since no stent
   - discontinued plavix 75
   - daily EKG
   -continue metoprolol at increased dose of 25mg PO BID, uptitrate as
   tolerated
   - ECHO showing EF 40%, Mild left regional regional systolic dysfunction
   with distal anterior, septal and apical hypokinesis c/w CAD. Mild
   mitral regurgitation
   Atrial Fibrillation/Pauses: appears that this is since [**3-26**]. RVR as
   fast as 160s. on the floor she was given 5mg iv lopressor and had 5s
   pause, appeared to be conversion pause. In CCU, about 30 minutes after
   metoprolol patient had >6s pause, asymptomatic but has been in sinus
   since.
   -continue metoprolol for rate control, uptitrate as tolerated
   -initially started on amiodarone for rhythm control but found to be
   hyperthyroid so discontinued
   -coumadin started for anticoagulation
   -need [**Doctor Last Name 2219**] of heart upon discharge
   -card follow up on d/c
   Hyperthyroid- by labs prior to starting
   -f/u thyroid antibodies
   -endocrine follow up arranged as outpatient
   Mental Status Changes: Patient was A+OX3 prior to getting dilaudid on
   admissiont so suspect medication effect.
   -avoid sedatvies
   - head CT negative
   - use narcotics with caution
   Fever: to 102 on arrival to floor. patient had cough, but per niece it
   is chronic [**2-2**] smoking. denies abd pain, urinary complaints. may be
   related to hip, atelectasis. Now afebrile last 24 hours.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u urine culture
   - CXR: no infiltrate
   Systolic CHF: acuity is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] of 20% is low for a first NSTEMI.
   Repeat echo shows improvement of EF to 40-45% which may represent
   Takutsubo
s, stress related cardiomyopathy.
   -monitor I/Os, daily weights
   PPx: subqhep, coumadin,  bowel reg
   FEN:  cardiac diet, replete lytes prn
   ACCESS: PIV x 2
   CODE: DNR/ok to intubate with the exception of during procedures
   (surgery or cardiac catheterization)
