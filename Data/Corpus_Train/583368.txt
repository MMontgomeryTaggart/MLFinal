Chief Complaint:  Chief Complaint: lightheadedness
   .
   Reason for MICU admission: GIB
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8248**] is an 88 yo M with history of aortic aneursym status post
   repair, MVR s/p porcine valve placement, atrial fibrillation and
   diverticulosis who presented with lightheadedness on the day of
   admission and is admitted with a GI bleed.
   .
   The patient reports he was feeling well up until the day of admission.
   On further questioning, he admits that he may have felt a bit weak one
   day prior.  He denies any recent illness, cough, headache, vision
   changes, dysuria, diarrhea or other symptoms prior to today.  He notes
   he woke up early this morning and felt very dizzy and "woozy" so his
   wife suggested that he come in to the ED for evaluation.  He also
   reports difficulty with urinary retention worse than usual secondary to
   his BPH which was concerning to him.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.3 P 78 BP 122/60 R 16 O2 sat 98% on
   RA. A foley was placed and per report approximately 200 cc of urine
   drained.  Patient had one set of partial orthostatics with lying BP He
   was found to have a 12 point Hct drop and INR greater than assay as
   well as acute renal failure.  Patient was given 1 L of NS, vitamin K 5
   mg PO x1, protonix 40 mg IV x1 and 2 units of PRBCs and 4 units of FFP
   were ordered.  He rec'd one unit of FFP prior to transfer to the
   floor.  Additionally, patient got up in the ED to urinate prior to
   foley being placed and fell.  Was possibly unresponsive mom[**Name (NI) **].
   CT head was negative.  He did sustain a considerable L knee hematoma at
   the time.
   .
   Of note, the patient had a complicated coure at the time of his prior
   cardiac surgery.  He was re-intubated due to respiratory failure and
   developed a left cephalic vein DVT.  He has been doing well since
   admission and has been on a stable dose of anticoagulation with INR
   checks monthly.  His last check was one week ago and was around 2.1 per
   his report.  He is not entirely sure why he is on anticoagulation, but
   notes he has been on it for the last year.  He denies any recent
   changes in his coumadin dose.
   .
   His last colonoscopy was in [**12/2503**] and showed diverticulosis of the
   sigmoid colon.  EGD at that time showed a large hiatal hernia and
   gastritis with normal biopsies.
   .
   On the floor, the patient feels well.  VSS.  He does not currently have
   any complaints.

   No acute intracranial abnl or fracture. Maxillary and ethmoid sinus
   disease.
   CXR: On my read, large globular heart, no significant pulmonary edema
   or infiltrate though poor quality film
   ECG: EKG: Occasional demand pacing with native rhythm which appears to
   be afib w/ PVCs, no significant changes from baseline other than pacing
   is more frequent
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is an 88 year old man with significant
   cardiac history who is admitted with significant coagulopathy, acute
   renal failure and a GI bleed.
   .
   # GIB: Patient had 13 point HCt drop over last week with
   lightheadedness and orthostasis.  No blood pressure drops or evidence
   of hemodynamic instability in the ED.  He did have guaiac positive
   brown stool, but no evidence of melena or BRBPR according to the
   patient.  INR greater than assay, though no clear precipitating
   symptoms.
   - Hold ASA/warfarin
   - Maintain access with 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T&C
   - 1 units prbcs now, will transfuse to goal of 30 given CAD and
   question of ischemic ECG changes with elevated trop, though this is
   most likely in the setting of ARF
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - NPO for now
   - Q4H Hct
   - Correct coagulopathy as below
   - GI fellow aware, no plan to scope at this time given coagulopathy, no
   indication for NGT given risk for trauma-related bleeding. EGD / [**Last Name (un) **]
   when stable
   - Bleeding scan if acute bleed
   .
   # Coagulopathy: No clear etiology for acute rise. Patient has INR
   checked monthly.  No recent illness, change in warfarin dosing or
   dietary changes.  Patient rec'd 5 mg of Vit K in ED as well as 2 units
   FFP, now INR down to 6.6.
   - Will give another dose of FFP now given knee hematoma and GI bleed
   - Additional FFP for any necessary procedures
   - Holding asa/coumadin
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # L knee hematoma: Occurred after traumatic fall in the ED.  Patient
   did have a prior knee surgery on that side, will need to clarify what
   type of surgery.
   - Follow CK
   - Will get plain films to assess for fracture or other underlying
   abnormality
   - Will ask ortho if there is any indication for further investigation
   .
   # ARF: Baseline creatinine around 1.1, now up to 2.6 over the last
   week.  Likely in the setting of hypoperfusion from GI bleed (also with
   large Hct drop as above). Initial UA relatlively non-diagnostic, some
   hyaline casts present.
   - Will send urine lytes
   - Urine eos
   - Avoid nephrotoxins including ACEi/lasix for now
   - Renally dose all meds
   - UA with reflex override to look for sediment / casts
   .
   # CAD: No current complaints.  Was feeling lightheaded in the setting
   of GI bleed.  Also with small trop bump to 0.03 and ?TWI that resolved
   in the ED.
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat ECG in am
   - Continue statin, hold metoprolol, felodipine, lisinopril as above,
   and aspirin
   .
   # Aortic aneurysm s/p repair: No current treatment
   .
   # BPH: Continue finasteride and terazosin with holding parameters
   .
   # DM type 2, insulin dependent: Continue home 70/30 with HISS, half
   dose 70/30 while NPO
   .
   # HTN: BP have been stable. In the setting of GIB, will hold
   metoprolol, CCB, lasix, and ACEi as above.  Restart when GIB resolved
   or BP becomes elevated
   .
   # FEN: Prbcs and FFP as above, IVF as needed, replete electrolytes prn,
   NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Supratherapeutic INR at this time, continue to monitor,
   IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] for GI bleed, bowel regimen prn

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 88M CABG/porcine MVR/Ao repair [**2506**], DM, HTN,
   PPM, tics, gastritis, AF on coumadin p/w weakness / presyncope in the
   setting of INR >20 and HCT 41 to 28. Fall in ED with micturition, head
   CT neg, L knee hematoma. GI aware, plan to scope once coags improved,
   now s/p 1u FFP, 1u PRBC, 5mg Vit K.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.3 BP 113/52 HR 60 (paced) RR 18 with sat 97 on
   RA. Labs notable for WBC 10K, HCT 28, K+ 3.8, Cr 2.6. CXR with clear
   lungs, EKG c AF/paced rhythm.
   Agree with plan to manage GIB in the setting of profound coagulopathy
   with FFP for INR<2, PRBCs for HCT >30, serial coags/HCT q6h overnight
   with IV PPI and upper / lower endoscopy when coagulopathy has resolved.
   He has good peripheral access. For ARF, continue fluid / blood
   resuscitation, hold cardiac meds including ACEI, check UA / sed / [**Street Address(1) 8249**] meds. For L knee hematoma, will check plain films, serial exams
   and d/w ortho given prior surgery. Troponin elevated in the setting of
   stress and ARF, will follow trend but doubt this is ACS. Remainder of
   plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 50 min
