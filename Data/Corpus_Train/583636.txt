Chief Complaint:  Ventricular Tachycardia
   HPI:
   This patient is a 67 y/o with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy
   s/p ICD for primary prevention (VT in past, [**12-12**], VF- shocked
   appropriately). He has been on amiodarone since since end of [**2887**], and
   developed thyroid dysfunction. He wishes to come off the arrythmia and
   presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**11-13**] for EP study for the possibilty of
   ablation to terminate the VT. He discontinued amiodarone 1 month ago.
   The patient had EP study for VT/VF ablation, and was shocked externally
   for VF. He LV and RV were mapped and there ws no scar seen, normal
   voltage. Given that there was no scar to ablate and he had VF in the
   lab, the plan is for dofetilide load. Of note, he had an 8 french
   arterial sheeth and 3 venous sheeths on the right.
   On admission to the CCU, patient was complaining of pain in his mid
   back. he denied chest pain, lightheadedness, palpatations, shortness of
   nreath

   pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
   pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
   - He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
   buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
