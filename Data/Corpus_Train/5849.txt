.
CXR ([**3097-4-9**]): Comparison is made to prior chest radiograph
dated [**3097-1-21**] and prior CT dated [**3097-1-19**].
Increased interstitial edema with more focal opacity within the
right lower lung, likely representing alveolar edema with
underlying consolidation less likely.  Recommend repeat
radiographs to assess for resolution. Stable appearance to small
pleural effusions, left greater than right.
.
CXR ([**3097-4-29**]):
1. Diffuse interstitial edema.
2. Developing confluent asymmetric airspace opacity in right
lower lobe. Although possibly asymmetric edema, aspiration or
infectious pneumonia should be considered.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
.
EKG ([**3097-4-9**]): Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response. Compared to the previous tracing of [**3097-1-24**] there is
atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The T
waves appear less biphasic in leads V2-V3, which may reflect the
change in rate.
.
PFTs ([**3097-2-25**]): The FVC is mildly reduced. The FEV1 is within
normal limits.  The FEV1/FVC ratio is elevated. Flow-Volume
Loop: Abrupt termination of exhalation with reduced volume
excursion. Volumes: The TLC is mildly reduced. The FRC, RV and
RV/TLC ratio are within normal limits. Results suggest a mild
restrictive ventilatory defect. However, FVC may be
underestimated due to suboptimal test performance, and lung
volumes are irreproducible. Since [**3093-2-23**], FVC has been reduced
by 1.06 L (35%). Since [**3090-12-24**], there is no significant change
in TLC or Dsb.
.
Echo ([**3097-1-15**]): Left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and systolic
function are normal (LVEF 70%). No ventricular septal defect.
The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
moderate ([**12-15**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with trivial mitral stenosis. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**3095-5-7**],
the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased; there is
now at least moderate pulmonary hypertension; and the right
ventricle is now dilated and hypocontractile.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo female with CAD s/p CABG, COPD, ESRD on HD, DM type II,
presents with worsening SOB and hypoxia and admitted with
probable RLL pneumonia, volume overload, atrial fibrillation
with RVR, and right LE cellulitis.
.
# SOB/hypoxia:  When the patient was admitted, she was found to
be volume overloaded with EKG demonstrating afib with RVR, and
additionally had RLL infiltrate on CXR.  A COPD flair was
thought unlikely as she was not wheezing.  She was initially
treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin and vanco and then
switched to zosyn and vanco because a long QT was noted on EKG.
She was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress in the
setting of rapid afib.  She underwent HD with ultrafiltration
with removal of 3L with improvement in symptoms.  She was
transferred back to regular medical floor with improvement in
her symptoms, but again triggered on the floor when she was
found to be experiencing palpitations, SOB, lightheadedness, and
was tachycardic 130-160s.  An EKG demonstrated sustained
wide-complex afib with RVR and exam demonstrated worsening
pulmonary crackles.  Efforts to restore normal sinus rhythm
failed with IV metoprolol and she was transferred back to the
MICU.  In the MICU, IV diltiazem was started with improved rate
control.  Cardiology was consulted and felt that wide complex
tachycardia was likely a. fib w/ aberrancy and unlikely VT.  She
was again loaded with amiodarone with maintenance of NSR and
rate control established with metoprolol.  During this time the
patient has been dialyzed with UF removal to reduce the volume
overload, and after each session she had improvement in her SOB.
 As the sessions were being limited by hypotension, she was
started on midodrine prior to each session.  She will be
discharged on 12.5mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and amiodarone 400mg daily
to be decreased to 200mg daily on [**3097-5-15**].  She has been
requiring supplemental O2 which should be continued to maintain
O2 saturations >93% and titrated off as possible with additional
fluid removal at HD.
.
# Leukocytosis:  Had significant bandemia of 10% on [**4-24**] which
has since resolved with WBC count trending downward from a max
of 19.6, now 14 on day of discharge.  Admission CXR showed RLL
infiltrate that on subsequent imaging had resolved and then
again reappeared in the setting of climbing WBC count.  She was
again started on levofloxacin with downward trend of her WBC
count, however was changed to zosyn for concern of widening QT
while on amiodarone.  She previously had significant diarrhea
during this hospitalization with repeated C. diff toxin A that
were negative.  Her diarrhea has since resolved and C. diff
toxin B is pending and should be followed up on.  Urine culture
was negative.  Last day of zosyn for probable aspiration
pneumonia is [**3097-5-10**] to complete a 7 day course.
.
# CKD on hemodialysis: She was continued on hemodialysis with
goal to remove excess fluid with UF.  Her phosLo was
discontinued as her phosphate had normalized, but this should be
monitored and restarted if again climbs.  Additionally, she has
been receiving 5mg midodrine prior to HD to maintain pressures
during HD, as amount of fluid removed during her sessions had
previously been limited by borderline blood pressures.  As she
remains fluid overloaded, the goal will be continued removal of
fluid with HD/UF and, thus, midodrine should be continued prior
to HD as needed.  She is next due for hemodialysis on [**3097-5-5**]
with goal, as above, to continue fluid removal.
.
# Atrial fibrillation and wide complex tachycardia: As above,
she was admitted due to hypoxia in the setting of A-fib w/ RVR.
She is now in NSR on amiodarone and HR consistently in the low
60s on 12.5mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **].  [**Last Name (un) **] rate controlled and in sinus
rhythm s/p amio load.  Her INR is therapeutic on 1mg coumadin
qhs and should be monitored especially while on antibiotics and
amiodarone.  She should be continued on amiodarone 400mg PO
daily and should be decreased to 200mg daily on [**5-15**].
.
# Epistaxis:  On hospital day 10 ([**3097-4-18**]) the patient
experienced an uncontrollable nose bleed that failed to respond
to pressure, Afrin, and packing in the MICU.  Her INR at the
time was therapeutic (2.6).  ENT was called and an anterior
perforation was seen.  The patient was decongested with
Afrin/lidocaine and the nasal cavity was cleared.  Surgicell was
packed into the R-nare (anterior and posterior) and L-nare
anteriorly and has since dissolved.  Coumadin was temporarily
held and has since been restarted and remains therapeutic
without any subsequently nose bleeds.
.
# BRBPR: Occurred in the setting therapeutic INR (2.6) and
severe epistaxis as above. Of note, has h/o UGIB in [**3091**] [**1-15**]
ischemic necrosis of transverse duodenum after aorto-SMA bypass.
GI evaluated and, as her hct has since remained stable, EGD and
colonoscopy can be pursued as an outpatient.  Hct remained
stable in the 24-27 and she is HD stable without evidence of
further bleeding.
.
# Anemia:  Although hct fluctuates, BL recently prior to this
admission appears to be in the low 30s.  hct during this stay
has been 24-29 and is likely [**1-15**] CKD and GI bleed and
iron-deficiency.  Recent iron studies reveals iron saturation of
11% (iron 15, TIBC 129, ferritin 428).  She was continued on
Epogen per renal recs and was started on iron supplemenation
which should be held 1 week to colonoscopy when scheduled.
.
# Hypertension:  Blood pressure remained well controlled during
her stay with the exception of BP dips during HD as discussed
above.  She will be discharged on 12.5mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] with
midodrine prn prior to HD.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG.  She was without signs of active ischemia
during her stay.  She was continued on ASA, statin, betablocker.

.
# Right lower extremity cellulitis:  Surrounding superficial
ulcer with erythema.  Treated x 8 days with vanco (and was on
zosyn for pneumonia #1) with resolution of surrounding erythema
and tenderness.  Superficial ulcer remains scabbed/dry without
evidence of persistent infection.  This exam should be
monitored.
.
# PVD: Patient with dry gangrenous left thumb tip without any
e/o infection.  No [**Hospital1 1092**] intervention currently as dry
gangrene.  Thus, dry gauze dressings should be applied daily and
exam monitored.
.
# COPD: Remained stable without e/o significant bronchospasm on
exam.  She was continued on tiotropium, advair, prn albuterol.
.
# DM: Her blood glucose was challenging to control during her
admission.  Her lantus was up-titrated somewhat with better
overall control.  She demonstrated some tendancy to become
hypoglycemic in the morning hours and so her bedtime sliding
scale was reduced with good effect.  The Humalog ISS and lantus
will need to be titrated according to her SS requirements.
.
# Hypothyroidism:  An initial TSH during the hospitalization was
elevated and on re-check it was still elevated.  Free T4 was
checked and was normal.  She was continued on her home dose
synthroid.
.
# FEN: Cardiac, diabetic, renal diet.  As there was some concern
for aspiration with thin liquids (okay with food), speech and
swallow evaluated her at bedside.  She is to use chin tuck
maneuver when drinking thin liquids and head of bed should be
upright when eating.
.
# Access: Dialysis line placed [**3097-4-12**], peripheral IVs
.
# PPX: Therapeutic from coumadin, PPI, HOB elevation, PT consult

.
# Code:  DNR/DNI as discussed with patient
