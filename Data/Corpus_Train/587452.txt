   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 58 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation on
   coumadin, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease,
   s/p CVA who presented to [**Hospital3 830**] on [**2836-2-13**] with heart
   failure exacerbation and atrial fibrillation with RVR, transferred due
   to difficulty with diuresis [**1-21**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Pump: Reported volume overload at outside hospital, however on
   arrival here CXR shows no evidence of volume overload and recent rise
   in creatinine.  At [**Location (un) **] creatinine had been ranging from 1.0-1.3
   with recent rise to 2.0 today.  He had been treated with 20mg IV lasix
   as well as oral lasix.  Given rise in creatinine and normal CXR,
   patient may be euvolemic at this time.  Going for CHF is O2
   requirement.
   - Hold further lasix overnight.  Trend creatinine.
   .
   # Acute renal failure likely related to overdiuresis given acute rise
   after multiple days of increased lasix dose.
   - Pre-renal lytes but Cr back to normal.
   - restart lisinopril for now given elevated creatinine
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm s/p cardioversion.
   Had not been on coumadin [**1-21**] supratherapeutic INR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will restart on amiodarone load 400mg PO BID, ideally for short term
   duration given his underlying lung disease.
   - Follow INR.  Restart coumadin when INR in 3 range, decreasing dose
   with amiodarone.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient had positive UCx at outside hospital, but
   unclear whether this was treated.  Not documented in chart.  Currently
   afebrile.  WBC count at [**Location (un) **] trending up from 11 to 13.
   - Repeat UA, Ucx
   - Repeat CXR in the AM
   - Trend WBC count.
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Severe based on recent echocardiogram.
   - Consider surgical evaluation in the AM.
   - Closely monitor volume status.
   .
   #. CAD: Reported history of CAD.  No history of MI and no prior cardiac
   intervention.
   - Continue ASA
   - Smoking cessation; nicotine patch if needed
   .
   #.  COPD: [**Month (only) 11**] be contributing to current picture.
   - Continue inhalers.
   - consider steroids, will get additional records if possible.
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # GERD
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   .
   # Chronic pain syndrome
   - Continue oxycodone
   .
   #. FEN
   - Low salt, cardiac heart healthy diet
   - Monitor lytes and replete PRN
   .
   #. Access: PIVs
   .
   #. PPx:
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **], bowel regimen, supratherapeutic INR
   .
   #. Code:  Full
   .
   #. Dispo:  CCU for now.
   - PT c/s in the AM.
