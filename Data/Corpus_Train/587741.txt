   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a PMH of CAD, moderate AS, and
   COPD admitted with acute onset dyspnea.
   .
   #. Dyspnea - The patient presents with acute onset dyspnea, similar to
   prior admissions, differential diagnosis includes acute diastolic CHF
   vs COPD exacerbation. Patients symptoms most likely secondary to CHF
   exacerbation given evidence of volume overload on exam and CXR. BNP
   elevated though decreased from prior. The patient has no evidence of CE
   elevation or new ischemic ECG changes. He likley has episodes of
   transient ischemia leading to acute-on-chronic diastolic dysfunction
   and pulmonary edema as described prior. The patient also reports brief
   feeling of "chest spasm" relieved with neb in ED, suggests possible
   component of reactive airway disease. No wheezing on exam currently.
   - Trend CE, negative x2 so far
   - Continue lasix IV, goal 1L negative
   - Continue lisinopril and metoprolol
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Hold on further abx/steroids for now
   .
   #. Coronary Artery Disease - s/p BMS to OM2, D1, Left circumflex in
   [**2728-11-26**] for unstable angina - pt has declined further attempts at
   revascularization. No current acute ischemic changes on ECG
   - Trend CE, negative x2 so far
   - Continue ASA, metoprolol and lisinopril
   - Goal HCT ~30 given history of ischemia
   .
   #. Moderate Aortic Stenosis - careful diuresis given increased preload
   dependence
   - BB and ACE-I as above
   .
   # Gout: On allopurinol. Started cholchicine at home dose
   #. COPD - continued home Ipratropium in neb form Q6H standing,
   scheduled for outpatient PFTs
   .
   #. Chronic GI Bleeds - Pt has had GIB in past on plavix, monitor HCT
   .
   #. FEN - cardiac diet, replete lytes PRN
   .
   #. Access:  PIV
   .
   #. PPx:  heparin SC
