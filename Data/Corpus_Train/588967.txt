Chief Complaint:  3rd degree heart block
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 61 year old female with history of seizures,
   hypothyroidism, CAD who presents from OSH with third degree heart
   block.  Patient is sedated and family not available to provide
   history.  Reportedly this AM patient was found down after using the
   bathroom.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 4549**] and found to be minimally
   responsive with HR 30s, low BP.  She was given atropine x1 with
   reported improved perfusion.  Right IJ placed and patient started on
   levophed.  BP improved after atropine so levophed d/c'd.  She was given
   4L IVF and started on dopamine gtt.  It was determined at [**Hospital1 594**] to
   transfer to [**Hospital1 17**] for further managment.  Medics began transcutaneous
   pacing, placed Aline and intubated patient in transport.  Of note, she
   reportedly had CP in AM but refused to go to ER for evaluation.
   .
   In the ED here, HR 70, BP 160/80, vented on AC 100% FiO2.  Labs notable
   for INR 2.1.  She was seen by EP.  RIJ was exchanged for cordis and
   temporary wire was placed with good capture.  She was also sent for CT
   head which was negative for acute bleed but showed evidence of
   subacute/chronic occipital and parietal infarcts.
   .
   On arrival to the CCU, the patient was intubated and paced at a rate of
   70s.  Dopamine was quickly weaned off and BPs have remained stable.
   She was responsive to some commands.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 61 year old female with history of seizures,
   hypothyroidism, CAD, arrhythmia who presents from OSH with third degree
   heart block now with temporary wire in place.
   .
   #. Third degree heart block: Likely progression of prior disease vs
   ischemia related.  Based on medication list does not appear to be med
   related.  Less likely lyme, SLE, post-surgical.  Presented with HR 30s,
   poor BP.  Temporary wire in place and pacing at 70 with good BPs.
   - Plan for pacemaker in the morning with EP.  Continue pacing
   overnight.
   - Will give 1 dose of vancomycin overnight in anticipation of
   procedure.
   - NPO as diet pending procedure
   - Will check coags, lytes in AM.
   - Patient on coumadin as outpatient, will hold but will not reverse
   with Vitamin K.
   - Likely will need cardiac catheterization prior to discharge to rule
   out ischemia.  Not acutely necessary.  Will attempt to obtain outside
   records in the AM.
   - Obtain outside records in the AM including old EKGs and medications.
   Based on list given to ED, patient not on any nodal blocking agents.
   - Discuss with team regarding further work up.
   .
   #. Pump: Euvolemic on exam.
   - Continue to monitor clinically
   .
   # CAD: Patient reportedly had CP this AM but did not present with such.
   - Continue to cycle enzymes
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: On oral agents at home.
   - Sliding scale for now.  Hold Metformin
   - Check hemoglobin A1c
   .
   #. s/p intubation:  Poor documentation but likely done for airway
   protection in setting of low BP and somnolence.  No evidence of hypoxia
   or hypercarbia.  ET tube appears to be appropriately placed.
   - Check ABG on current settings: 7.35/37/252.  Lactate 1.8
   - Will attempt to extubate following EP procedure.  Do not believe
   there is an underlying pulmonary condition.
   - Repeat CXR in the AM.
   .
   #. Syncopal episode: Likely related to poor cerebral perfusion [**3-1**]
   third degree heart block however patient also has history of seizures
   and verbal report of tonic clonic movements this AM.
   - Continue dilantin - need to obtain dose in AM.
   - Treat CHB as above with temporary wire
   .
   #. FEN
   - NPO for procedure
   - Monitor lytes and replete PRN
   .
   #. Access:
   - RIJ with temporary wire
   - Aline
   - PIV x1
   .
   #. PPx:  PPI while intubated, therapeutic INR
   .
   #. Code:  Presumed full
   .
   #. Dispo:  CCU for now.
