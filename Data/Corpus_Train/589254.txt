   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with pmh significant for dilated right sided systolic
   heart failure and diastolic left sided heart failure, presenting with
   hypoxia and hypotension in the setting of diarrhea.
   Presumed pathophysiology: Diastolic left heart failure with secondary
   pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.  In setting of volume
   depletion, left sided pressures dropped more than right, allowing for
   increased shunting via dilated PFO. Now improved with volume repletion.
   Plan: Right heart cath to evaluate for safety and response to
   vasodilators
 concern of pulmonary edema given left heart failure. If
   able to lower pulmonary pressures, ultimately may undergo PFO closure.
 HYPOXEMIA- Poorly responsive to O2 from shunt physiology, now
   improving with stabilization of hemodynamics.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) - Likely secondary to known L sided heart
   failure, in the setting of volume depletion, myocardial
   ishemia/infarction. Patient was initially volume depleted, now appear
   total body overloaded by exam, although intravascular volume may still
   be low. Now off dopamine
   - Fluid restrict with goal for euvolemia.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Pt with poor R heart
   function, markedly dilated RV and RA. Now with significant R->L shunt
   via large PFO, as well as TR. Difficult situation as PFO may be
   offloading some RV pressure but leading to significant hypoxia.
   - Appreciate cardiology recommednations.
   - Avoid significant systemic vasodilatation
   - Plan for R heart cath next week and trial of NO to access pt
   ability to tolerate pulmonary vasodilators, in hopes of eventually
   closing PFO.
   - wean dopamine as tolerated
   - Cardiac enzymes: CK peaked trending down, Trop still elevated. Likely
   demand ischemia.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Cr peaked at 3.4, now
   2.8 today. Increasing urine output, now oliguric. Likely ATN given poor
   perfusion on admission.
   - Appreciate renal recommendations
   - Follow Creatinine and urine output.
   - Hold torsemide, spironolactone until improvement in renal function
   - Workup for glomerular etiology given proteinuria and hematuria is
   pending, though less likely as continues to improve.
   #.Hyponatremia: Stable/slightly worse since admission. Hypervolemic,
   likely due to CHF exacerbation and diarrhea.
   - Will continue to monitor as renal function improves and pt self
   diuresis.
   - stop salt restriction in diet.
   # LFT abnormalities: Elevated AST but not ALT. Also Alk phos, GGT but
   not bilirubin. Liver US shows no pathology. Multiple possible causes:
   congestion secondary to right heart failure and TR, etoh induced. PSC
   ruled out with neg AMA
   - unclear if function compromised (INR 1.4, Alb ?, no thrombocytopenia
   or megaloblastic anemia) or if findings are due to malnutrition. Could
   consider trial of vit K to eval for response and rule in/out liver
   cause.
