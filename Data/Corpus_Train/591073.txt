I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note, including assessment and plan.
   Chief Complaint:  uncontrolled hypertension
   HPI:
   42 yr old hx of depression with SA, poorly controlled HTN, hyperaldost,
   type A dissection repair, also hx of type B aortic dissection
   compromising left renal artery.
   Admitted with elective repair of type B dissection (new graft) +/- left
   RA stent. In [**Hospital 2539**] clinic was hypertensive, sent to ED. Sent to CVICU,
   BP controlled with labetolol drip, labetolol PO and NGT drip, clonidine
   patch, lisonopril, hydral, and HCTZ-triamt. BP continued to be > 160s
   systolic.
   At home, BP frequently in 200s with frequent headache.
   Because of hxof hyperaldo, was felt that hypertension related to
   primary hyperaldosteronism.
   Since transfer, off NGT and hydral drip. Started on Spirinolactone with
   IV hydral to keep BP 140-160s.
   24 Hour Events:
   Spironolactone increased from 25 to 50 [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   Got one IV dose of hydralazine yesterday am.

   Assessment and Plan
   42 y/o M Malignant HTN, Type A dissection s/p emergent repair in [**2856**],
   Type B dissection, Depression admitted now transfered for further
   medical management of HTN and hyperaldosteronism
   .
   # Malignant HTN/Hyperaldosteronism: Given his hx of elevated
   Aldosterone, decreased PRA, HTN in setting if hypokalemia, this is c/w
   primary hyperaldosteronism. CT abd reveals stable lipoma but no adrenal
   adenoma.
   - appreciate endocrine recs
   - f/u repeat renin, [**Male First Name (un) **] after salt load and K repletion
   - serum metanephrines -normal
   - continue 50 PO BID spironolactone
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes to monitor K
   - Clonazepam held
   - He is still on a broad range of oral agents will attempt to wean if
   he responds.
   - f/u Psyc recs re: SSRI
 ok to start celexa
   -Will reduce labetolol to 400 tid.
   - d/c aline.
   .
   # Type B dissection: with dissection flap extending into the left renal
   artery, and probable areas of left renal infarct.
   - goal SBP 140-160 (he reportedly gets hypotensive sx when SBP<120's
   per surgery service)
   - per vascular, they can tolerate SBP 160's
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 30 today
   - if large drop, will contact vascular given risk of extravasation
   .
   # L Renal infarct: Likely in setting of dissection
   - continue to monitor renal status
   .
   # Depression: Currently denies SI but does endorse depressed mood. Very
   tearful this morning and feeling very overwhelmed.
   - social work consult today
   - f/u with psych
   - started risperdol per psych
   - start SSRI today (Celexa)  per psych.
   - clonazepam dose decreased
   .
   # FEN:
   - regular low Na diet
   .
   # PPX:
   - SQ heparin
   - bowel regimen as no BM in 4 days
   FAMILY: wife supposed to come to visit today.
   DISPO: if SBP stable in the goal range 140-160 over the course of the
   day he should be stable for transfer to floor.
