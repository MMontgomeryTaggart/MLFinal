   - pt s/p cath with clean coronaries.  No CP but EKG with STE and
   positive troponins at OSH
   - pt refused hip surgery and hip x-rays here.  Pt wishes to return to
   [**Hospital3 **] to get hip surgery.  Pt would not give permission to
   have us talk with family members.
   - K 5.5, EKG unchanged. Kayexylate given.  Need to repeat K later

   ECHO:
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
   right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity is small. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). The right
   ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
   dilated with borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal
   systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
   valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
   left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with PMHx of chronic back pain, diabetes, HTN, pulmonary
   HTN and triscupid regurgitation who presented to OSH with mechanical
   fall and found to have a hip fracture who was incidentially noted to
   have ST elevation on EKG and troponin leak.  Doing well overall
   .
   # CORONARIES/ACS:  Pt with positive enzymes and EKG changes c/w a
   STEMI, however cath revealed clean coronaries.  ST changes persist and
   were possibly secondary to demand vs. vasospasm.
   - post cath check
   - cont lisinopril
   - trend CE
   - EKG in am
   - aspirin 81 mg
   - ECHO obtained on arrival to CCU
   .
   # PUMP: Echo with LVEF of 70%.  Pt with right ventricular failure.
   Most likely chronic secondary to pulmonary HTN which is long-standing
   per son.  However, possibly secondary to PE.
   - monitor O2 sats and RR, if decompensates t/c empiric heparin vs stat
   CTA chest.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR
   - monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Hip fracture: Pt with documented hip fx on imaging and PE.
   - ortho consult appreciated
   - Pt refusing both OR and plain films currently.
   - pain control with morphine and tylenol.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia - K elevated at 5.5. EKG without evidence of hyper K.
   - kayexylate
   - repeat K this PM.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus vs. IGT: pt not on medications as outpt and has no
   knowledge of carrying the diagnosis.  Blood glucose measurements have
   been elevated while in-house.

   refusal to got to OR for hip repair.
