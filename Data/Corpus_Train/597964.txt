Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Decreased Amio because HRs in 50s and CO worse when bradycardic
   - renal wanted to [**Name6 (MD) **] off RRT for one more day because do not think
   will tolerate HD with such low BPs and want to see what MR is like on
   TTE before trying renal replacement.
   - PM lytes were worse hyponatremia likely from fluid overload consider
   RRT as therapy as already decreased PO intake and not enough IV meds to
   cause this
   - CDiff negative (diarrhea a few days ago)

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # Cardiogenic shock/MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR
   but not a flail leaflet. Off pressors completely. Continue to have very
   low U/O ; off CVVH [**1-11**] to low bp. Subsequently MAP 55-65
   - continue Hydral, nitro for afterload reduction given MR -> split up
   so doesn
t get them all at once
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   # Diarrhea:  C Diff negative from [**4-3**]
   # Normocytic anemia:  Stable. Folate, B12 and Fe studies
   noncontributory to anemia. Will continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Has been stable over last days.
   # ARF:Most likely contrast nephropathy. Creatinine rose to 3.0 today
   and has had very minimal urine output. Since MAPs in 55-65 range off
   CVVH she may tolerate HD. Renal recs appreciated.  Crn at baseline on
   admission 2.0
   - monitor uop
   - will likely require long term dialysis
   - HD started today, monitor BP with HD with goal SBP>90
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes for now
   - Will follow up renal recs
   # Hyponatremia: From volume overload as patient is not making much
   urine. Sodium increased to 127 from 126. Will likely improved as fluid
   is removed with HD
   - pm lytes after HD
   # Rhythm: aflutter/fib
   - Heparin gtt
   - continue amiodarone 200mg QD
   # Gout: Allopurinol QOD
