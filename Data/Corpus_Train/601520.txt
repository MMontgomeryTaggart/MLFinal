   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU for Ultrafiltration after
   failing to increase UOP on aggressive diuretic regimen with very active
   LGIB overnight.
   # GI BLEEDING: History of UC. Status post clipping/injection of ulcers.
   Most likely precipitant for bleed is CHF. GI on board, rec monitoring
   HCT and if this decreases they may go in again to evaluate, however
   unlikely.
   - Continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **], ferrous sulfate
   - PIV x2  plus CVL
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: s/p RH cath showing elevated
   RV, LV pressures but no elevated pulmonary pressures (thus making the
   concern for idiopathic pulm HTN unlikely). Ovenight there was a problem
   with UF machine and did not get fluid out. Continued on Vasopressing
   with MAP of 64 (average).
   -Continue vasopressin for hypotension with aggressive fluid removal as
   this will have no B1 activity and will not increase heart rate which
   would worsen her diastolic dysfunction. If needed will switch to
   phenyelphrine
   - Continue beta blocker for HR control given diastolic CHF will be
   worsened from tachycardia and want to give LV long enough time to
   fill.
   - Continue Ranolazine for diastolic dysfunction as some evidence this
   does improve diastolic CHF.
   - Continue fluid restriction
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of today. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. Concern that she will develop ischemic ATN if renal perfusion
   does not improve.
   - UF as above
   - No need for dialysis now as electrolytes wnl
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal is following
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Continue ASA for ppx->no coumadin given GIB recently
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2861-3-30**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-31**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks
   - Continue aspirin at 81, off plavix due recent GI bleed and
   questionable necessity given no CVA from PFO.
   # PPX: heparin SC, PPI IV BID, holding bm regimen given diarrhea
   # ACCESS: PIVs, PICC placement [**2861-4-7**]
   # CODE STATUS: full- confirmed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   # EMERGENCY CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **] is HCP: [**Name (NI) 804**] ([**0-0-**])
   # DISPOSITION: CCU for CVVH
