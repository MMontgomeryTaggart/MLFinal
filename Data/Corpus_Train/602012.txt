   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  66 yo F with MR, bipolar disorder who presents with altered
   mental status, fever, and hypotension.
   .
   1.  Hypotension:  Remains off levophed,  lactate remains normal.  Given
   high fever and now GNRs in bcxs from admission, concern for septic
   shock.  Possible sources include UTI (positive U/A), UCx pending.  Less
   likely to be pneumonia given no clear infiltrate on CXR yesterday and
   today.  Less likely to be meningitis given lack of HA, neck stiffness,
   photophobia.  Currently appears euvolemic after fluid resuscitation by
   ED; good UOP overnight.  Does not appear to be cardiogenic but will
   repeat ECHO.
   - f/u urine cultures, blood cultures
   - sputum culture if can produce
   - check legionella
   - IVF boluses prn with caution given dCHF
   - hold lasix for now
   - vanc and zosyn for UTI, ?[**Last Name (LF) 8526**], [**First Name3 (LF) 167**] tailor abx to culture data
   .
   2.  Acute mental status changes:  Unclear baseline given MR, bipolar.
   Pt alert and oriented x3 and to president.  Able to relay medications.
   No recent changes to medications.  ABG in ED did not show hypercapnia
   though with sig. history for this.
   - cont. cogentin, haldol per patient insistence
   - hold seroquel, topmax for now
   - will need family to assess mental status
   - if mental status changes worsen, will re-gas and try bipap
   .
   3.  Tachypnea:  Patient extremely wheezy.  Known restrictive lung
   disease.  BNP only 500, less likely to be cardiogenic wheeze.
   - nebulizers q4 standing, q2 prn
   - cont. Advair
   - avoid steroids given h/o steroid-induced psychosis
   - CPAP for OSA, home settings of (CPAP 19cm/4L)
   - consider CTA if no improvement, hold off while in ARF
   .
   4.  Sinus Tachycardia:  Improved after IVFs.
   - IVFs prn
   - consider CTA if no improvement, hold off while in ARF
   # Fall:
   Difficult to obtain history.  DDx inc. cardiac, arrhythmia, worsening
   of AS, med effect.
   - monitor on tele
   - rule out CEs, ASA
   - repeat ECHO
   - hold seroquel, topamax
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Baseline Cr of 0.9, is at 1.2 this AM. Furosemide had been held.
   - Follow-up urine lytes
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   #  h/o Hypertension:
   ?hypotensive in ED.  Is now normotensive off of home meds.
   - Restart furosemide today
   # Diastolic CHF, mild aortic valve stenosis:  Currently euvolemic.
   - monitor fluid status, I&Os, O2 sats given fluid resuscitation in the
   ED
   # Bipolar disorder:
   - cont. lithium, haldol, congentin
   - hold seroquel, topmax for now given ?mental status changes
