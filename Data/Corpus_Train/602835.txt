   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo male with history of morbid obesity, WPW, HTN, hyperlipidemia
   presents with A fib with RVR.
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Resolved,  admitted with A fib with RVR.  The patient
   has been in sinus rhythm in the 40-50s, initially with very clear signs
   of WPW, posterior right septal bypass tract, but now narrow complex.
   - Ctes to be in sinus with slight bradycardia on 80mg TID propranolol
   so will decrease propanolol dose to 60 TID today
   - continue coumadin, however since no evidence of thrombus on TEE done
   yesterday, will not require bridge for discharge
   - Will require EP study for ablation of WPW bypass tract as an
   outpatient
   - Will require coumadin monitoring as outpatient which will be set up
   for him before he leaves
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]: Confirmed presence by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5081**] after reviewing TEE
   from [**Hospital1 95**], however no evidence of thrombus on TEE done yesterday
   - Continue Heparin drip until discharge, however does not require
   bridge
   - Increased coumadin to 10mg
   .
   # Febrile Illness: Presentation and CXR consistent with CAP.
   - Continue doxy/ctx (first dose [**3006-4-26**]), day 6 of 10, will discharge on
   cefpodoxime and doxycycline
   - Urine cultures negative, however foley pulled, some hematuria
   - F/U  Blood and sputum cultures, negative to date
   - D/Ced Foley
   .
   # Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: overtreatment with levoxyl. Following TFTs
   - restarted levothyroxine at lower dose
   - care with propanolol as it prevents conversion of T4 to T3.
