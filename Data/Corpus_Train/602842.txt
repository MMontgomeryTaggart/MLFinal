   - Multiofcal pneumonia with a moderate right pleural effusion which
   appears to be superior to the large RML and RLL consolidation, raising
   the question of loculation. Accurate evaluation is limited due to lack
   of IV contrast (witheld in the setting of Cr=2.2). concomitant
   multifocal areas of consolidation, groundglass opacities and septal
   thickening with a mixed subpleural and central distribution
   (particularly left), part of this is due to multifocal pneumonia, may
   also have some contribution from superimposed mild edema.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 5161**] is a 46 yo M with PMH HTN, hyperlipid, h/o ETOH abuse
   presenting with hypotension, hypoxia RLL infiltrate and acute renal
   failure.
   .
   #Sepsis - likely [**3-7**] pneumonia given RLL infiltrate/effusion on CXR, no
   evidence of urine infection at this time.  Most likely CAP vs
   aspiration pneumonia given h/o profuse vomiting prior to onset of
   dyspnea.  Severity of systemic illness worrisome for staph or strep
   pneumo.  Other consideration is legionella given associated nausea and
   vomiting as well as significant hypoxia on admission.
   -vanc/levo for now to cover for CAP and possiblity of MRSA pna
   -continue aztreonam, vancomycine, levofloxacin, d/c flagyl
   - thoracentesis  yesterday with pH 7.1, CT with ? of loculation
   - thoracics on board for likely decortication in next 24-48hrs
   -IVF for CVP <10 (already given 7L IVF in ED)
   -off pressors
   -f/u blood cx, urine cx, stool cx
   -send sputum culture if able to provide sample
   -urine legionella antigen negative
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - with relatively [**Name2 (NI) 5162**] sediment, moderate amount
   of blood but no casts on urine microscopy.  CK is not elevated.  Per
   patient no history of kidney disease at baseline.  Likely [**3-7**] sepsis
   and volume depletion.
   -renal ultrasound to eval for post obstructive cause although unlikely
   -drastically improved c/w pre-renal etiology
   -renally dose all meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   -already given 7L IVF in ED and CVP 10 on admission, hold off on
   further volume resuscitation for now
   .
   #anemia, thrombocytopenia, relative leukopenia with significant
   bandemia - likely [**3-7**] severe pneumonia and sepsis.   Also worrisome for
   possibility of DIC
   -improved today
   -monitor cbc, diff
   -fibrinogen, fdp, ddimer to eval for DIC negative
   -iron studies, retic count to eval anemia
   -active type and screen
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation
 appears to be new onset while in ED likely [**3-7**]
   severe pneumonia, hypoxia and sepsis.  He was started on heparin gtt in
   the ED presumably in case of need for cardioversion given concurrent
   hypotension.
   -monitor on tele
   -start low dose metoprolol for rate control
   -hold heparin gtt for now as plan for thoracentesis, may consider
   restarting if afib persistent and clinically stable if plan for
   cardioversion.
