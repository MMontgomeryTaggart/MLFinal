TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  Pleuritic right chest pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient started on coumadin
   - [** 919**] briefly decreased (although unclear whether this was due to
   accidental foley removal), [** 919**] responded appropriately to 500 ml LR
   bolus with [** 919**] 60-70 cc
s per hour this am
   - patient briefly developed non-gap acidosis with bicarb of 19,
   resolved with substitution of LR for NS for fluid boluses
   S: The patient is feeling well.  Her chest pain has entirely resolved.
   She continues to have dry-mouth as well as her baseline amount of cough
   and shortness or breath.  She has not had N/V diarrhea.  No pain or
   swelling in her legs.

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o chronic eosinophilic lung disease, COPD, diastolic CHF,
   and recent admission for MSSA and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas PNA who
   presents with fevers, right sided pleuritic chest pain and found to
   have extensive R sided PE on imaging.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM: Likely due to prolonged immobilization with
   inadequate anticoagulation.  TTE performed yesterday appears showed L
   and R ventricles to be largely unchanged from patient
s previous echo.
   Patient started on coumadin 3mg with subsequent INR at 1.3.  Has been
   hemodynamically stable.
   - transition from heparin drip to lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   - will continue coumadin at 3 mg today and recheck INR; patient is
   hesitant to take coumadin long-term.  Will need to discuss long term
   coumadin vs lovenox with her PCP ([**Doctor First Name 9082**] [**Doctor First Name **]) and her pulmonoligist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1997**])
   - continue close monitoring of hemodynamic status
 FEVER: After initial Tmax of 103.4 in ED, the patient has now been
   afebrile for over 24 hours.
   - will d/c abx today given her excellent clinical response to treatment
   of PE and clinical appearance not consistent with bacterial pneumonia
   - obtain sputum sample for culture in the event that patient spikes a
   fever
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and temp curve
 HYPOTENSION: Patient has been at at her usual BP (per outpatient OMR
   notes) of systolics between high-80
s to low 110
   - continue fluid bolus to goal SBP >90, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 919**] >30 cc/hr
OLIGURIA: It is unclear whether the low recorded [**Name (NI) 919**] overnight was
   truly oliguria or due to the foley being accidentally removed;
   regardless her [**Name (NI) 919**] has been satisfactory since this receiving a 500 cc
   LR bolus.  Creatinine of 0.6 suggests good renal function
   -d/c foley, encourage PO intake
   - monitor I
s and O
HYPONATREMIA: Patient with Na at nadir value of 133 (down from 138) at
   4am on [**5-17**], likely dilutional given substantial amount of NS she
   received since admission.  Has improved overnight with  decreasing
   frequency of fluid boluses.
   - check lytes daily
 HYPOKALEMIA: Patient has refused PO K repletion, therefore will
   continue to slowly infuse IV K so as to avoid pain at infusion site.
   Patient
s daughter reports that she takes her own K supplementation at
   home; if her daughter brings this in she can take this form of PO K
   instead.
   - check pm K
NON-GAP ACIDOSIS: Likely due to hydration with large volumes of NS.
   Has improved with changing fluids to LR.
   - continue LR for fluids
   - check lytes daily
HISTORY OF EOSINOPHILIC LUNG DISEASE: No evidence of exacerbation of
   disease at this time
   - continue home dose prednisone 5 mg daily
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: LENI
s reveal
   significant clot burden ( R common fem extending into greater saphenous
   and profunda femorus, L peroneal)
   - switch heparin drip to lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
 ANEMIA: Stable at patient
s baseline Hct in mid-to-high 20
   - check Hct daily
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION: Patient appears at her baseline
   breathing status without increased SOB or cough, however is requiring
   supplemental O2 likely due to large PE.
   -  wean O2 as tolerated
   - continue home COPD meds
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Patient currently
   appears euvolemic-to-dry, and is without cardiac symptoms.  Minimal ST
   depressions seen on initial EKG (< 1mm in V4-V6) likely due to demand
   since cardiac enzymes have been negative x3.  Echo yesterday showed
   ventricular size and function largely unchanged from previous echo.
   - continue home meds
 H/O Atrial fibrillation: Patient was initially in afib on arrival to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 42**] in setting of fever, tachycardia and hypotension but has been in
   sinus rhythm since 7pm.
   - continue to monitor on tele
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Low-sodium diet
   Glycemic Control:  Patient has been euglycemic, continue monitoring
   with daily labs

   16 Gauge - [**2969-5-16**] 04:58 PM
   20 Gauge - [**2969-5-16**] 04:59 PM
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: heparin drip
   Stress ulcer: PPI
   Communication:  Daughter [**Name (NI) 642**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9067**]
   [**Name2 (NI) 62**] status: Full code
   Disposition: Likely call out to medical floor later today
