Chief Complaint:  SAH, elevated troponin
   HPI:
   [**Age over 90 363**] y.o. male with PMHx of atrial fibrillation recently stopped taking
   Coumadin for unclear reasons, CAD s/p CABG on ASA/Plavix CHF, HTN,
   brought into an [**Hospital 924**] Hospital after an unwitnessed fall. Patient
   was found at the bottom of the stairs of his home by his wife,
   unconscious. [**Name2 (NI) **] only last recalls climbing the stairs with his walker
   after returning from the bank. He denies CP, SOB, palpitations,
   lightheadedness/dizziness as he was ascending the stairs. As he was
   taking the last step, he seemingly lost consciousness, not recalling
   anything else until he regained consciousness in [**Hospital 924**] Hospital.
   Imaging at [**Hospital1 924**] revealed a SAH as well as a posterior laceration
   that was stapled. His neck was cleared based on plain films and
   physical exam which was notable for an awake and alert patient, denying
   pain. Patient was noted to have an elevated troponin of 0.1. He was
   thus transferred to [**Hospital1 52**] for neurosurgical and cardiac evaluation.
   .
   In the [**Hospital1 52**] ED, repeat imaging showed a stable SAH. Neurosurgery was
   consulted and noted a normal neurological exam and deferred surgical
   management. He was loaded with Dilantin and his INR of 1.8 was reversed
   with vitamin K and FFP. Repeat cardiac enzymes were significant for a
   troponin of 0.11 with an EKG significant for atrial fibrillation,
   otherwise no ischemic changes. Given the combination of SAH, though
   stable and not necessitating surgical intervention as well as the
   question of NSTEMI, patient was admitted to the ICU for further
   monitoring.
   .
   Upon arrival to the floor, patient was well-appearing, resting
   comfortably in bed without complaints. He specifically denied chest
   pain, shortness of breath, palpitations. He lives alone with his wife
   at home and ambulates with a walker at baseline. He reports infrequent
   falls and says that what few falls he has experienced is usually as a
   result of ambulating too quickly or getting up from a seated position
   too quickly and getting dizzy. However, he is always aware of his falls
   and can recall them. He says that this event is distinctly different in
   that he cannot recall what happened.

        [image002.jpg]
   Imaging: CT Head ([**5-19**] - Preliminary Read): Stable appearance of SAH
   when compared to earlier scan, bilateral, but predominantly over left
   hemisphere. No new ICH seen. Complete opacification of left max. sinus
   with high density material, unchanged, may just be chronic
   sinus disease but please correlate clinically with pain at this site
   TTE (1/'[**95**]):The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
   pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior septum,
   apex, and basal to mid inferior walls and severe hypokinesis of the
   anterior wall . Overall EF severely depressed (25%). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic
   valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area
   1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
   small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
   loculated inferior to the left ventricle and anterior to the right
   atrium without evidence for tamponade.
   .
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2595-12-16**], the left
   ventricular function has severely decreased. Compared with the
   immediate prior study (image reviewed) of [**2596-1-13**], the right
   ventricular function is now normal.
   ECG: Atrial Fibrillation, LAD, no ischemic changes
   Assessment and Plan: [**Age over 90 363**] y.o. male with an extensive cardiac history who
   presents s/p what appears to be a syncopal episode with resultant head
   laceration and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   .
   # Syncope: Suggested by history and injuries sustained. Patient without
   a prodrome to help localize cause. Exam significant for murmur of
   aortic stenosis and echo confirms this in [**2595**]. Concern for symptomatic
   aortic stenosis. Differential otherwise would include arrhythmia,
   seizure, orthostasis and less likely MI/ACS or PE.
   - Will repeat TTE
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Cycle enzymes
   .
   # SAH: Per neurosurgery, pursuing conservative management. Neuro exam
   largely normal less some brisk DTRs. Mental status appropriate. INR
   reversed with vitamin K and FFP.
   - Continue Dilantin
   - Q4 neuro checks
   - f/u neurosurgery recs otherwise
   .
   # Troponin Leak: Patient with extensive cardiac disease, now with
   troponin leak in despite normal renal function, though arguably,
   creatinine of 1.1 in this elderly gentleman still likely reflects
   decreased creatinine clearance. Still, concern is obviously for
   myocardial ischemia, which given normal EKG would likely be NSTEMI,
   specifically. Patient is already on ASA, BB, statin and ace-inhibitor
   as well as Plavix. ASA and Plavix will obviously have to be held in the
   setting of SAH.
   - Continue to hold ASA and Plavix
   - Can likely continue BB, ace-inhibitor and statin
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   - TTE as above as well as to rule out WMA and evaluate EF
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently hemodynamically stable. Holding
   anticoagulation as above, though patient's CHADS2 score is at least 3
   as he denies a history of stroke and has no known DM, though OMR
   reports a history of TIA which would increase his score to 5.
   - Continue BB as BP tolerates
   - Hold Coumadin while with SAH
   .
   # Anion Gap Acidosis: Unclear etiology. BUN is only mildly elevated and
   likely attributable to steroids and certainly not at the level of
   uremia that might otherwise account for an anion gap. Pt. is
   hemodynamically stable without a fever to suggest lactic acidosis,
   though lactate has not been checked. Pt. does not have a history of DM
   and tox screen is negative for alcohol or salicylates.
   - Will check a lactate
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology and platelet count has never been
   this low before. Differential is obviously broad in general and
   includes consumptive vs. poor production. Patient has been on Plavix,
   but otherwise has no signs of TTP. Isolated throbocytopenia raises ITP
   higher on the differential. Regardless, will need to be closely watched
   while with SAH.
   - Continue to monitor and transfuse for acute bleeding and or < 10
   - Hold PPI for now
   .
   # PMR
   - Continue steroids
   .
   # FEN:
   - Correct/Replete electrolytes PRN
   - NPO for now in case patient goes for surgery. Otherwise,
     cardiac/heart-healthy diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis
   - Pneumoboots
   .
   # Access
   - PIV
   .
   # Code: Full, though patient has living will in chart with specifics
   .
   # Communication: Patient and daughter/HCP: [**Name (NI) 357**] [**Name (NI) 4191**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8986**]
   .
   # Disposition: pending above
