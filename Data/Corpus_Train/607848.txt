   Assessment and Plan
   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and RUE DVT, who is being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 42**]
   with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: unclear etiology, possibly in the setting
   of hypovolemia vs malignant pericardial effusions vs infection/sepsis.
   Responded to amiodarone in the past.
   - rate control w digoxin at baseline
   - if unstable, consider phenylephrine bolus vs amiodarone 150mg IV vs
   metoprolol IV if BP tolerates
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - telemetry
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely combination of poor po intake w
   possible sepsis [**12-25**] infxn (?line infxn), worsened by afib w RVR.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - no a-line for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Agitation: intermittently delirious
   - haldol PRN
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**1-29**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**4-11**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 [**12-25**] Infxn vs steroids.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for treatment
   and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count should be
   kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   # Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**12-25**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - Has been increasing over past few
   days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   # Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently complaining
   of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous admission. GI
   recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an outpatient
   esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   # Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.
   .
   # GERD - Continue pantoprazole.
