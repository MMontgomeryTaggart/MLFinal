   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O CARDIOMYOPATHY, OTHER
 .H/O CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 .H/O DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   80 year old female with multiple medical issues s/p recent MI with
   cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 3VD deemed not amenable to
   intervention and she's a too high risk candidate for CABG. She now
   returned to the outside hospital with an inferior STEMI and is
   transfered for revaluation for option of revascularization. On arrival
   pt appears stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia.
   .
   #) CAD: currently cp free.
   - trend enzymes
   - continue aspirin, hold off plavix until surgical opinion, iv heparin,
   wean off iv nitro, lipitor, zestril.
   - start metoprolol at 25mg tid and titrate up dose.
   - obatin angiography film from [**Hospital1 **]
   - discuss with ct [**Doctor First Name 204**]
   .
   #) CHF: well compensated at present despite recent MIs and low ef.
   - will repeat tte here to confirm measurement of high PA pressure as
   well as severity of as.
   - continue metoprolol, lisnopril, lasix
   .
   #) a fib:
   - now in sinus rhythm.
   - continue to monitor on tele.
   - cont metoprolol
   - clarify why not anti-coaguated, likey [**12-22**] thrombocytopenia and
   bleeding risk
   .
   #) AS:
   - repeat echo reassess aortic valve area and stenosis. however in the
   setting of severe lv dysfunction and poor forward flow this may be
   overestimated.
   .
   #) thrombocytopenia:
   - thought to be secondary to hepatitis c.
   - wil repeat plt level.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - on heparin drip, ppi.
   .
   #) DNR/DNI. Will confirm with patient

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 562**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   80 yr old woman recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 3574**] with cath showing tight
   LM and diffuse CAD not well suited for revasc.
   Now transferred from [**Hospital3 2751**] with new cardiac event:  CP with
   inf STEMI and CK 1339.
   EF 15-20%, with moderate AS with [**Location (un) 330**] 1.0.
   Hx of PAF, Hep C with decr Plt.
   Physical Examination
   No chest pain.
   Mild AS with preserved A2 and good carotid upstrokes.
   No edema or rales.
   Medical Decision Making
   Will review films when available from recent cath at [**Hospital1 3574**] to see if
   CABG or PCI is option but suspect will continue Med Rx.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 360**] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
