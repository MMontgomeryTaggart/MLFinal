Chief Complaint:  2:1 AV block
   HPI:
   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   presyncope.  She apparently fell 10d ago with unclear details.  Again
   yesterday, she was walking to TV to change channel and suddnely felt
   LH/dizzy and hit the TV with her right side of ribs.  She remembers
   falling and did not hit head/neck.  She came to OSH ED for her rib
   pain.
   .
   At [**Location (un) 76**] she was noted to be in 2:1 heart block with bradycardia to
   30s-40s and BP 170-200/40-60.  She was given glucagon 3mg and zofran
   4mg.  HR had minimal response but blood pressure remained stable at SBP
   160s.  Patient transferred here for EP eval.
   .
   In our ED:  VS: HR 40s, 188/56, 97% 2L, RR 20.  EKG with intermittent
   2:1 heart block noted w ventricular rate 50; LBBB (old) and prolonged
   QTc.  CXR w ? pulm edema but no rib fractures.  SL ntg x1 given for
   hypertension and she was admitted to CCU for EP eval.
   .
   Currently, she reports slight right rib pain which worsens with deep
   inspiration.  She denies LH, dizziness, CP, palpitations, SOB.  She
   reports taking normal amounts of PO intake and her meds over last week.
   .
   On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
   deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
   surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
   stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
   exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems
   were negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea
   on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

   STUDIES
   EKG: 2:1 AV block w vent rate 50 (intermittent), NA, prolonged QTc,
   LBBB
   .
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2536**]:
   Conclusions
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
   There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular systolic function. No transthoracic
   evidence of PFO by color doppler.
   Mild pulmonary hypertension is noted.
   Assessment and Plan
   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.  .
   .
   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - EKG in am
   - will d/w EP in am re ? pacer as this appears to be symptomatic
   bradycardia a/w 2nd degree AV block.
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear but perhaps some mild pulmonary congestion on exam.
   Will keep I/O even for now but consider lasix if pulm edema worsens.
   Suspect cardiac output will improve with increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Hold ACE in
   setting of renal dysfunction and try hydral prn.  Hold atenolol w
   bradycardia.  Treat pain with morphine.  Tolerate SBP 170s
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.5 with GFR 35.  Will hold
   ACE tonight and keep I/O even.  Check urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium
   - check u/a to risk assess for delirium
   .
   Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 75.  Will check TSH given the
   bradycardia.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now until stabilizes
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SQH
   -Pain management with morphine IV and tylenol PO
   -Bowel regimen with senna/colace
