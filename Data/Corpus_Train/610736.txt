Chief Complaint:
   DKA
   PNA
   Acute on Chronic renal failue
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 year-old male with poorly-controlled IDDM complicated by retinopathy
   and nephropathy and hypertension admitted with a  day of abdominal
   pain, nausea and failure to take home insulin or or other medications.
   When he went to bed [**4-17**] was feeling well, although he did note a few
   days of dry cough, fatigue, no fevers, chills or night sweats. He also
   noted that he had increasing #s of bowel movements (he states he
   normally has a BM 1 X / week). No sick contacts at home. No recent
   travel or new foods.   He notes that he does make urine.
   In ED , afebrile, VSS, mildly tachy. and received 4L of IV hydration,
   insulin push followed by insulin gtt and levofloxacin for PNA.

   Assessment and Plan
   24 year-old male with poorly-controlled IDDM complicated by
   retinopathy and nephropathy, hypertension, and chronic kidney
   disease with recent Cr near 7 admitted with DKA and worsening [**Doctor First Name **]
   function as [**Last Name (un) **] as abd pain and ? LLL PNA
   >DKA: hAs a hx of IDDM. Glucose at 691 on admit (no serum ketones or
   urine ketones drawn yet) but serum HCO3 is down and he has a AG. Will
   start hydrate gently and start insulin gtt until gap closed
   and then restart home long acting reg. PNA and abd pain as possible
   underlying etiologies on a back drop of poor compliance.
   - Obtain ABG
   - insulin gtt and restart long acting when gap closed
   - Gentle IV hydration as a challenge (and standing D5 1/2NS when blood
   glucose is <250)
   - close monitoring of electrolytes (Mg, PO4, K) although also with
   chronic worsening renal failure
   - pan clx to r/o infection as an etiology
   - touch base with Jos DM service for help optimizing management
   >Renal failue: underlying picture thought to be [**12-23**] DM and HTN. At this
   point he will probably need to have access established for HD during
   this admission although perhaps his acute worsening
   may be in someway related to mild dehydration in the setting of DKA.
   Over the longer term it seems likely he will need HD soon. There does
   not appear to be an acute indication at present although we will look
   at his [**Doctor Last Name **] to make sure compensated from an acid base status.
   - Renal consult for initiation of HD and ? evaluation for transplant
   over the longer term
   - Gentle hydration (he did receive 4L in the ED)
   - ? phos binders
   - check coags for possible HD line placement
   > Abdominal pain: most likely [**12-23**] DKA or PNA although worht checking
   LFTs to eval liver/gallbladder and [**Doctor First Name **]/lip for pancreatitis.  If any
   focality to exam or lab abnl's then would favor imaging
   > PNA: radiographic evidence of PNA but no fever, WBC or other
   symptoms. He does have GERD and probably diabetic gastroparesis which
   would increase risk for aspiration
   -  Seems most reasonable to cover for now with levofloxacin  and
   ceftriaxone for now
   > HTN: retstart home medication regimen (metoprolol, hydral and
   amlodipine) as he can tolerate. We can use IV hydral and metop over the
   short term if needed.  Notably a TTE in [**3079-1-19**] was nl EF with mild
   LVH and mild MR.
