   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**1-30**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5961**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5961**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. Other etiologies,
   such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less likely
   given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse. Either
   way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess if his
   cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely improved
   after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has diuresed
   about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid overloaded
   as evidenced by moderate pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   overnight should be even to slightly (500 cc) negative, but there is no
   need at this time to aggressively diuresed as his fluid overload should
   get better after tomorrow
s procedure. Rate control should be enough
   for him for now to control his symptoms.
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   -          I/O goal net even to slightly (500 cc) negative
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation tomorrow should
   improve his LV function
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG. He is on an
   aspirin for unclear reason. We will hold the ASA for now.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: cardiac diet, NPO for TEE after midnight
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace
   # CODE: full
   # DISPO: CCU for now
   # CONTACT: wife: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5937**]
   1.       We did not restart any of his rate/rhythm medications.
   However, we may use IV diltiazem if necessary tonight.
   2.       We did not restart any of his COPD meds because of the risk
   that they may increase his heart rate and even exacerbate the flutter.
   If he develops respiratory distress overnight that is related to
   wheezing, we may consider ipratropium.
   3.       [**Location (un) 147**] risk score is 20%, so ASA for primary prevention is
   a good idea to decrease risk of MI in the next 10 years.
   4.       K is 5.2, but right now we can see how he does in the morning.
   CHADS2 is [**1-30**], wish is 4%.
