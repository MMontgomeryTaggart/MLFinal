   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total
   protein (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP
   (<2.5) suggests SBP. It is the measurement of the ascetic fluid total
   protein concentration that assists in differentiating SBP from
   secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein concentration
   correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is thought that
   the low protein concentration correlates with low concentrations of
   opsonins, which decreases the efficacy of innate immunity in the
   peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see [**Last Name (un) 7589**],
   Gastrooenterology [**3143**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7589**], Hepatology [**3145**]). We know that most
   cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella) and that
   sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus can be the
   culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum antibiotics is
   warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was started on
   ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**3167-5-5**]). Furthermore, patients
   with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired renal function, which
   often results in increased morbidity and mortality. By administering IV
   albumin (which expands plasma volume and increases blood flow to the
   kidneys), one reduces morality rates at three months from 41% to 22%
   (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**3156**]). Therefore, our patient was also given
   albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday, and will receive an additional 1.0g/kg on
   day 3 ([**3167-5-7**]). In terms of long-term prophylaxis, the patient will
   require a weekly dose of 750 mg ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life
   because it decreases incidence of SBP from 22% to 3.6%, without
   development of acquired resistance to ciprofloxacin (see Rolachon et
   [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**3152**]).
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7589**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**3149**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely etiology because the vast
   majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension secondary to
   cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely cause given her low AFTP
   (CHF is associated with high AFTP), and
   , especially since she does not have have a history of alcohol abuse.
   it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause in our patient.
   In terms of diagnosis of ascites, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   ascetic fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS and recent episodes of
   bradycardia, hypotension. History also significant for leukocytosis,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .
   # h/o liver cirrhosis:  Underlying etiology unknown. Followed by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 2537**] at [**Hospital1 17**]. Previously attributed to steatohepatitis. Complicated by
   portal hypertension, ascites. MELD 24, CHILDS B.
   - Abdominal ultrasound with doppler
   - Ultrasound-guided paracentesis (diagnostic)
   - Liver recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2537**]
   - Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  No clear source of infection. Differential diagnosis
   includes aspiration pneumonia, SBP, UTI. Was given levofloxacin IV at
   OSH given suspicion for aspiration pneumonia.
   - CXR
   - UA
   - Urine culture, blood cultures
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline 1.7. Creatinine now 3.3.
   Differential includes ATN secondary to respond hypotensive episode
   (although patient was with renal failure prior to episode yesterday),
   prerenal etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic
   stenosis. [**Month (only) 47**] also be secondary to medications - recently started on
   HCTZ.
   - Urine lytes, UA
   - Close monitoring of urine output
   - Hold diuretics
   .
   #. Diabetes melliitus, type II:
   - Continue Humalog sliding scale per home regimen
