   - Renal c/s - More c/w Pre-renal azotemia. Urine sediment with many
   casts more c/w ATN. Less likely HRS given normal BPs and active
   sediment. Added on Urine Eos.

   octreotide. Decision deferrred until Liver team can see the patient in
   person

 AORTIC STENOSIS
 ASCITES
 KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.  Unknown etiology.  On CTX for 5 day
   course.
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**3167-5-5**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg today
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Transfer to liver service now that pt is stable
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  Severe, new dx.
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 204**] c/s for non-emergent intervention
   - cards will continue to follow while on floor
   # BRADYCARDIA.  Down to 50
s while sleeping.
   -          holding anti HTN
   -          EP consult, appreciate recs
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  Cr at 3.4, down from 3.7.  Baseline
   1.7.  Sediment suggestive of ATN given casts, and hypotension at OSH.
   Also consdiered HRS though less likely.   UOP improving over last 24
   hours, 400 since MN.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   -  Continue trending creatinine [**Last Name (un) **]
   -          IV albumin today
   -          monitor UOP
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  Stable at 27 this morning.  The patient had a drop in
   hematocrit from 32 to 25 yesterday.  Guaiac neg.  Pt reportedly on
   epogen 10,000u qSaturday.
   - trend daiy
   - will ask renal about why pt on epogen
   # HYPOTENSION:  Resolved.  Likely in setting of SBP.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone as abov
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - decrease ASA to 81mg
   - Holding anti HTN as above
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   #. PUMP:  EF 65-70%.  AS as above.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension.
   - Hold lasix
   #. Diabetes melliitus, type II:
   - Continue Humalog sliding scale per home regimen
