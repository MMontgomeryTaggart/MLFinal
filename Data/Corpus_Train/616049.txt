   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo with  with fevers, hypotensive, dyspnea and altered mental status
   with acute on chronic resp failure (OHV).  Concern for sepsis/septic
   shock with potential infection sources including HD line, R foot wound,
   lungHis MS is most likely explained by combination of infection,
   hypotension and more likely significant  hypercarbia --this seems to be
   improving with BiPAP. Unclear if he was getting frequent narcotics as
   sedating med effects likely further contributing
   >Sepsis: multiple sources for infection: HD line, recent TMA
   debridement, aspiration.  No obvious source of non infectious fevers
   (PE etc).  HD line seems most reasonable source but hesitant to remove
   in the absence of positive clx.
   - Vanco by level, Pip-Tazo for broad spectrum coverage for empiric 14
   day course
   - Obtain a clx
   - Cont NE requirement wean as tolerated
   - Judicious use of fluids.
   >Altered MS: multifactorial including infection (with increased
   metabolic production CO2) and OHV now much improved. Can - -
   -obtain VBG to follow his CO2. Would empirically use BiPAP for altered
   MS a
   >OHV: no documented sleep study but is hypercarbic
   - out pt sleep study
   - avoid narcotics
   >Renal failure: s/p failed cadaveric transplant.  HD T, Th, Sat
   (interrupted run on sat)
   - HD today (tolerating well on low dose NE)
   - cont 5 mg prednisone for chronic ejection
   >Afib:  Currently  in Afib s/p failed cardioversion (not on anti
   coagulation due to fall risk)
   - restart digoxin  (hold metop for now) on M, W, F dosing given high
   level on admit
   - check dig level
   >Wound care: s/p TMA
   - cont ASA and plavix
