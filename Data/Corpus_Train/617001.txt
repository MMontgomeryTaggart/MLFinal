   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   currently in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB. Pt continues to be
   therapeutic on coumadin with INR 2.8 this morning
   - restart sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] (home dose is 160mg PO BID)
   - Recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - Recheck INR in afternoon, restart coumadin if INR decreased <2.3,
   once bleed stabilized
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Complication of PVI procedure. Measured at 12x 5 cm
   on CT wet read, with no retroperitoneal bleeding. 2 units PRBC given
   post-procedure, Hct bumped initially to 2 units from 29.4-> 36.0, but
   3am labs show Hct 31.9. 3am Hct of 31.9 likely more indicative of Hct
   after equilibration, indicating Hct did not increase appropriately. In
   the setting of hemodilution with IVF during/after procedure and
   therapeutic INR, she may have continued bleeding. Exam indicates no
   expansion, of hematoma suggesting stablization.
   - f/u Hct at 9am, then noon Hct
   -Monitor physical exam for signs of bleeding or expansion of hematoma
   - f/u final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Pain control with Tylenol #3
   - Check afternoon Coags; if INR<2.3,  and bleed stabilized, may restart
   coumadin
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   overload on exam. Exam c/w adequate peripheral perfusion.
   -Monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   -strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   # TRANSIENT HYPOTENSION: During procedure became hypotensive, on
   transfer was on 0.8 of neosynephrine, but weaned off pressors soon
   after arrival.
   - monitor hemodynamics
   - if remains stable, w/ SBPs >120, restart metoprolol and valsartan as
   tolerated
   .
   # GERD: not currently active.
   - continue ranitidine 150mg PO BID.
   .
   #  Hyperlipidemia: stable; not currently treated with statins.
   .
   #FEN: Cardiac Heart healthy diet.
