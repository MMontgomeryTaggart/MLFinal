   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 41 yo man with h/o GERD and recently diagnosed stable
   angina who presents s/p elective cardiac catheterization with concern
   for RV microperforation.
   .
   # RV Microperforation:  The patient presented for elective cardiac
   catheterization today at [**Hospital1 17**].  During the procedure, the wire was
   attempted to be advanced through an apical thrombus and possibly
   resulted in RV microperforation.  The patient has remained
   hemodynamically stable and he is being monitored closely in the CCU.
    - Repeat TTE at 7:30 PM negative for pericardial effusion; will repeat
   TTE this AM
    - Continue to monitor pulsus q1h overnight
   .
   # CAD:  The patient has a three week history of stable angina, for
   which he underwent cardiac catheterization today.  The patient had a
   99% stenosis of his LAD, now s/p DES.  He is currently chest pain free,
   and the heparin and integrilin gtts were d/c'd in the setting of
   possible RV perforation post-cath.
    - Restart integrilin and heparin gtts in setting cardiac enzymes and
   no symptoms for RV perf
    - Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg TID and up titrate as tolerated
   - ContinueAtorvastatin 80 mg daily given low HDL and high LDL
    - Continue ASA and Plavix daily
   - Start an ACE-I
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient is currently in NSR.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # GERD: Currently stable.  Continue on Pantoprazole, though switch
   patient back to Nexium at discharge.
