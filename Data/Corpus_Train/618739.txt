TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events: Pt notes no chest pain, shortness of breath. Only notes
   left gouty toe and left knee tendonitis. Pt very concerned by events
   and would like to discuss goals of treatment.
   -Two episodes of VT @220.  First, at 1330 ([**7-10**]) patient collapsed to
   floor, ICD fired. Milrinone reduced to .375 mcg/kg/min. Second, at 0400
   ([**7-11**]) patient felt palpitations/rapid heart beat and then passed out
   device fired. Milrinone turned off. After both events patient returned
   to vpaced rhythm. Electrolytes at the time stable from the morning.
   - Patient actually had low bp's after milrinone decreased, increased
   neosynephrine slightly
   - Talked to pharm re: SC heparin dose in obese patients.  Stated that
   they don't typically adjust dose based on body weight but they "have
   seen 7500units TID used before" and if we want to switch to that, we
   can.  Left it at 5000units TID.

   ECHO ([**7-10**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated
   with severer global hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
   left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, jet of moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior
   study (images reviewed) of [**3330-2-21**], left ventricular cavity size is
   minimally smaller and systolic function is minimally improved. Right
   ventricular free wall hypokinesis appears more global, but of similar
   magnitude.
   Assessment and Plan
   43yo male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with severe dilated non-ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid
   obesity with weight in excess of 415 lbs., s/p BiV/ICD with LBBB, OSA
   who was directly admitted to CCU for decompensated systolic CHF
   requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis and now with 40 Liters
   diuresed.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Length of stay 45 liters
   diuresed.  Continues diuresis at approx. 6-7 L daily, goal will be to
   maximize diuresis.
   - Consider restarting Milrinone with Amio?????
   - Milrinone off and Neosynephrine 0.6 mcg/kg/min infusion; will
   tolerate MAP > 55.  Will try to wean him off neosynephrine as BP
   tolerates.
   - continue IV lasix gtt at 30 mg/hr
   - continue Metolazone 5mg PO BID
   - continue spironolactone 50 PO daily
   - continue metoprolol 100mg PO TID
   - hold lisinopril at this time
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Chem 7s
   - Replete Potassium 40 meq IV TID/PRN
   - Acetazolamide 500mg Po Daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: with biV/ICD. Two episodes of fast VT (rate 220s) which
   resulted in ICD firing x2. V paced rhythm returned. Continues with
   freguent non- sustained episodes of VT.
   - Hold Milrinone at this time.
   - Check K TID, and give an extra 80 meq of K today on top of 40 TID;
   goal of 5.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Metoprolol 100mg PO TID
   - Avoid amio at this time as patient has had clear trigger of Sustained
   VT; low K and on milrinone
   -Avoid digoxin as this may potentiate arrythmia
   #Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: intravasculary low volume which triggers
   ADH; Developed slowly over the past week on lasix gtt. 127/78 today.
   - Continue to monitor
   - When lasix gtt stopped will follow to assure controlled return to
   normal.
   .
   # Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Secondary to poor cardiac output.
   Creatinine on admission 1.5 up to 1.9 today.
   - continue to hold lisinopril at this time
   - monitor Creatinine
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD, no cath in past
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Gout: Flare in left big toe.
   - continue colchicine q 6 hours with tylenol
   # Diarrhea: Started on loperamide yesterday for diarrhea related to
   colchicine.
   .
   # OSA
   - not on bipap at home
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Regular, low sodium (allergies to shellfish, bee stings),
   1500ml fluid restriction
   Glycemic Control:  Good control on [**Hospital1 7**] Chem7
   Lines: Multi Lumen (Right IJ) - [**3330-7-3**] 10:25 PM
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: Heparin SQ refused this AM dosage; start pneumoboots; avoid
   lovenox as renal function is low
   Stress ulcer: Not high risk.
   VAP:  Not on ventilator
