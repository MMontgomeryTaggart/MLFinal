   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old female with a history of metastatic renal caricnoma to the
   brain, spine and lungs who was admitted for planned vertebrectomy and
   reconstruction of T8 and T9 who postoperatively has developed fevers,
   tachycardia and imaging suggestive of pneumonia.  Acute on chronic
   respiratory failure with superimposed nosocomial PNA s/p recent OR
   procedure and intubation with multiple lung resections, possible tumor
   spread.
    Hospital Acquired Pneumonia:
   - vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin for hospital acquired pneumonia
   will course out for a 10 day regimen (day 2 today)
   - incentive spirometry and OOB today
   - blood, sputum cultures
   - wean supplemental oxygen as tolerated
   Wheezing/ Bronchospasm: may be related to lypmhangitic spread vs
   infection
   - levo-albuterol and ipratropium nebs standing Q6H
   - guaifenesin for cough (as well as narcotic as below)
   -CT neck and torso unrevealing for central obstruction
   Tachycardia: attributing to multifocal pneumonia and underlying
   malignancy, postoperative status
   -for now will manage expectantly and per [**Doctor First Name **], transfuse 1u PRBC
   -need to keep in mind PE as a possible etiology (less likely at this
   point) and workup if clinically indicated
   s/p T8 + T9 vertebrectomy and reconstruction
   - PT consult once respiratory status stable
   - dilaudid 2-4 mg PO Q4H:PRN for pain
   - f/u neurosurgery recommendations
   Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma:  Most recently taking evrolimus as
   part of the RAD001 protocol. She is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as her
   primary oncologist.
   - continue aranesp; clarify and resume equivalent Epogen in-house
   - Onc following
   Remainder of plan as per housestaff note
