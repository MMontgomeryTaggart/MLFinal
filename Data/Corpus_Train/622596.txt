TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  altered mental status, urinary retention
   HPI: Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7516**] is a 78-year-old male with PMH significant for BPH,
   HTN, several prior CVAs, and seizure disorder who presents now with
   worsened AMS from baseline, fevers, leukocytosis and positive
   urinalysis concerning for looming urosepsis. Per patient's wife, he had
   chills and shivering at home over last 24 hours followed by fevers to
   Tmax 101F. He seemed unsteady on his feet, fatigued and much less alert
   than his usual baseline. She also noticed his home indwelling foley
   catheter had dark urine that appeared blood tinged.
   .
   Of note, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7516**] was seen in the [**Hospital1 5**] Urology Clinic on [**2687-8-10**] for
   recent followup for an acute episode of urinary retention after being
   seen in the ED on Sunday, [**2687-8-7**], and having a foley placed at that
   time which, per OMR records, drained 900cc clear urine. Urinalysis was
   negative at that time for any infections but there was some evidence of
   microhematuria ( [**4-7**] RBCs). At his recent Urology Clinic visit his
   foley catheter that was placed on [**2687-8-7**] was not removed given the
   brief time between placement and his clinic followup. He was also
   placed on Flomax .4mg PO qdaily to help
   optimize an upcoming voiding trial.
   .
   In the ED, initial vital signs were: Temp 100.F, BP 150/76, HR 89, O2
   saturation 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Labs in ED notable for a WBC of 17
   (81% neutrophils) and lactate of 2.6.  He was given total of 4.5L of
   normal saline IVFs, Vancomycin 1g IV x1, Zosyn 4.5mg IV x1, and then
   2mg Ativan and 5mg Haldol for some agitation.  Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   patient was somnolent but arousable and appeared to be in no apparent
   distress.

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   In summary, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7516**] is a 78-year-old male with h/o BPH, seizure
   disorder, prior intracranial hemorrhages, and HTN who p/w shaking
   chills, fever, and hematuria in the setting of a Foley placed 1 week
   ago for urinary retention.
   #SIRS:  Patient has leukocytosis, fevers, and tachycardia which support
   SIRS criteria. Also had lactate of 2.6 in ED. He responded to 4L IVF in
   the ED and his systolic blood pressure is now in the 140s range.
   Tachycardia has resolved but still having low grade fevers at this
   time. CXR negative for infiltrate. Most likely source of infection is
   urological/UTI given positive UA and indwelling foley catheter.
   --will continue broad coverage with Vancomycin 1g Q12H & Zosyn IV
   --maintain UOP >50cc hour, continue generous IVFs overnight (MAP goal
   >65)
   --follow-up blood cultures, urine cultures
   --maintain 2 large gauge PIVs
   --follow-up Urology consult recs
   --monitor BUN/Cr
   --will discontinue indwelling foley overnight and consider CBI if
   begins to produce clots or if UOP decreasing
   #Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to UTI/urosepsis which has
   worsened his already baseline dementia status. Head CT shows no acute
   changes from priors. He has known encephalomalacia in the right
   occipital region is unchanged since [**2683**] and he also has some
   periventricular white matter hypodensities which signify small vessel
   chronic infarcts. Patient was given 2mg Ativan and 5mg Haldol in the ED
   which also appears to have left him much more somnolent.
   --Repeat more thorough neuro exam when patient is more alert and
   sedation has worn off
   --PRN Haldol for agitation
   --will consider soft restraints as needed if begins to pull on
   lines/foley
   --Continue home dose Aricept
   #BPH: Longstanding history per OMR notes and patient's wife mentioned
   he had a green laser procedure to shrink his prostate size and he had
   been off of his Flomax for several months leading up to this past week
   when he was placed back on it.
   -follow-up urology recommendations
   -switch out indwelling foley to new foley/keep in place overnight
   -monitor BUN/Cr
   -continue on Flomax daily
   #HTN: Longstanding history of elevated blood pressures. In setting of
   SIRS will plan to hold all anti-hypertensive medications at this time.
   -start home dose HCTZ when vital signs stable for >24h
   #Seizure Hx:
   -continue on current regimen of Trileptal
   -will notify neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7518**], that patient is here in ICU
   #CVA Hx: CT stable with no acute changes, nonfocal neurological exam
   --will repeat neuro exam q8 hours overnight
   #FEN: monitor electrolytes and replete as needed, NPO for now given
   sedated state and history of vocal cord dysfunction, continue with IVFs
   overnight for hydration; switch to LR to avoid non-AG metabolic
   acidosis
   #ACCESS: PIVs x 2
   #PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT prophylaxis with pneumoboots, avoiding anticoagulation in setting
   of gross hematuria
   -Pain management with Tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with Colace and Senna tablets
   #CODE: DNR/DNI, confirmed with HCP & wife
   #Social - main contact and HCP is wife [**Name (NI) 102**] [**Name (NI) 7516**]
   - cell# [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7513**].
   #DISPO: Continue on ICU service for monitoring of hemodynamics
   overnight, if stable tomorrow may be able to transfer to regular
   medical floor
