   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -check methemoglobin after 2 days of nipride
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -start low dose BB and observe response
   -per surgery, will obtain CT chest w/o contrast to eval aortic ca+,
   carotid U/S, and U/A/Ucx
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 86**] re plan for CABG
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction. Given his very high SVR and severe MR,
   afterload reduction with IABP and nipride drip will likely be more
   effective, but will consider direct inotropy with dobutamine if cardiac
   index does not respond. He is also in heart failure with elevated
   filling pressures and will likely benefit from preload reduction with
   diuresis.
   -nipride drip, gently titrating to increase CI while keeping map>60,
   UOP and mentation.
   -gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -TEE today
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 86**] re likely MVR/AVR
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia
   -very low dose BB
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs trending down this AM.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2761**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7154**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Improved hemodynamics and good diuresis with Nipride, IABP and lasix.
   PA 55/26 adn C.I. 4.0 with SVR 850.
   CK peak 850
   Prelim TEE report shows severe MR, possibly amenable to repair and
   moderate AS.
   Physical Examination
   +JVD.
   No distress.
   Distal pulses OK with IABP.
   Medical Decision Making
   Discuss timing of cardiac surgery.
   Continue diuresis with Nipride and lasix.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
