Imaging:
-CXR ([**2815-5-23**]): No acute cardiopulmonary radiographic
abnormality.
-CXR ([**2815-5-29**]): There is no evident pneumothorax. There are low
lung volumes with increasing bibasilar atelectasis, larger on
the left side. If any, there is a small left pleural effusion.
Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. There are no other
interval changes.

-TEE ([**2815-5-26**]):
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace to mild
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-16**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
were notified in person at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is atrially paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. Valvular functiojn is
unchanged. The thoracic aorta is intact after decannulation.

-Carotid US ([**5-25**]/ Right ICA 60-69% stenosis. Left ICA 40-59%
stenosis.

-Cardiac CAth [**2815-5-22**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed LMCA disease. The LMCA
had a
90% distal stenosis. THe LAD had mild luminal irregularities.
The LCX
had mild luminal irregularities. The RCA is known occluded.
2. Limited hemodynamics showed mild hypertension with central
pressure
of 142/61/75 mmHg.
3. Arterial conduit angiography showed via nonselective imaging
the RIMA
was widely patent with patent distal stent. The RIMA was unable
to be
engaged selective via the right radial approach (using many
differnt
catheters) or via the femoral approach using an [**Female First Name (un) 887**] guide.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24064**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2815-5-22**] for further
management of his chest pain. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization and was found to have a 90% stenosed left main
coronary artery. Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac
surgery service was consulted for surgical management. Plavix
was continued given his drug eluting stent from [**2814-12-16**].
He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a
carotid duplex ultrasound which showed right internal carotid
artery of 60-69% stenosed and a left internal carotid artery
40-59% stenosed. He complained of thigh claudication, mostly in
his right thigh, which is reporoducible with walking 100-200
yards and relieved by rest. His non-invasive vascuilar studies
were normal however. On [**2815-5-25**], Mr. [**Known patient lastname 24064**] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent a redo sterontomy with
coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. He developed
post-operative atrial fibrillation and converted to sinus rhythm
with amiodarone. Beta-blockers were continued. Aggressive
pulmonary toilet continued.  His oxygenation improved but still
required supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  His glyburide
was restarted with blood sugars 69-170's. Insulin sliding scale
continued. He was seen by physical therapy service for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. He was
discharged to the Hellenic Rehab [**Telephone/Fax (1) 24065**] on POD5. He will
follow-up as an outpatient.
