Chief Complaint:  respiratory distress
   HPI:
   40 yo homeless [**Male First Name (un) 1945**] admitted for workup of acromegaly, found to have
   laboratory abnormalities consistent with tumor lysis syndrome, now
   being transferred from the floor for increasing respiratory distress.
   .
   On review of the chart, he was admitted on [**2699-7-1**] as OSH transfer for
   multiple concerns including bell's palsy, urinary retention, pituitary
   macroadenoma, acromegaly, persistent sinus tachycardia, scrotal pain
   and swelling, bilateral LE weakness, and thecal/ epidural enhancement
   in thoracic region and tumor lysis syndrome concerning for underlying
   malignancy.
   .
   Prior to transfer, he had been received 150cc NS/hr for rising tumor
   lysis labs and becoming progressively more dyspnic with increasing
   oxygen requirement. Cardiology had been consulted for persistent sinus
   tachycardia non-responsive to IV fluids and he was started on po
   metoprolol 50mg TID.  He was being treated w/ acyclovir and prednisone
   for question of viral-induced Bell's Palsy. Endocrine and neurosurgery
   were following and work up ongoing for pituitary macroadenoma and
   acromegaly. MR of T spine was performed to evaluate LE weakness,
   without evidence of cord compression. Heme/onc on the day prior to
   transfer attempted bone marrow biopsy but could not obtain due to
   respiratory distress induced with prone positioning.
   .
   At the time of transfer, patient was receiving 150cc NS/hr, received
   20mg IV lasix x3 in 8 hours. UOP had been good but oxygen requirement
   had increased to 5L.
   .
   On arrival to the MICU, non-invasive ventilation was attempted but
   unsuccessful [**2-6**] facial structure. He received nitro gtt, morphine 2mg
   Iv, metoprolol 10 mg Iv, and 40mg IV lasix without improvement in his
   respiratory status and was intubated.

   Imaging: [**2699-7-2**] CTA IMPRESSION:
   1. Left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
   2. Limited assessment for pulmonary emboli but no vascular filling
   defects identified.
   3. Marked irregular thickening of central airways, which may accompany
   an infectious process, but given its very prominent appearance and
   irregularity, an infiltrative neoplastic process could be considered
   such as Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma, particularly if there is a
   history of HIV. Sarcoid is felt less likely.
   4. Splenomegaly and paraspinal masses which suggest extramedullary
   hematopoiesis or lymphoma.
   5. Perfusion heterogeneity in each kidney with marked urothelial
   thickening, consistent with ureteritis and pyelonephritis. However, in
   addition, the marked degree of urothelial thickening could suggest an
   additional
   infiltrative process.
   6. Marked anasarca and anorexia.
   7. Thickened appearance of the stomach of unclear significance, given
   the lack of distension.
   .
   [**2699-7-2**] MR T spine:
   Thin epidural enhancement in the mid thoracic region anteriorly likely
   represents enhancement of the epidural veins; similar thin enhancement
   is noted on the surgface of the cord more so in the lower portion.
   These are not assessed on the axial post contrast images, as these are
   markdly limited by motion. Compariosn with prior study would be
   helpful.
   Scattered areas of enhancement in the vertebral bodies again need
   comparison with OSH to confirm.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 40M homeless, acromegaly / macroadenoma p/w
   respiratory failure. W/u notable to date notable for elvated LDH /
   tumor lysis syndrome, thecal enhancement on MRI, sinus tachycardia,
   Bell's palsy, orchitis. This AM, developed worsening respiratory
   distress despite lasix, failed NPPV, intubated.
   Exam notable for Tm 101.5 BP 130/40 HR 130 RR 25 with sat 94 on VAC
   600x25/18 5 1.0. Prominent brow. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft, scaphoid.
   Labs notable for WBC 11K, HCT 34, K+ 3.9, Cr 0.7, lactate 5.4, BNP
   1600, LDH 6800. CT c pronounced bronchovascular thickening but no focal
   ASD.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure with ongoing VAC support,
   may need to increase PEEP and RR for ongoing respiratory distress.
   Cause unclear, suspect some component may be infectious or related to
   tachycardia induced cardiogenic edema, but the CT is most concerning
   for infiltrating malignancy. Will continue vanco / CTX / cipro, and
   will hydrate for now while following up echo. Will need BMBx to r/o
   marrow infiltration given tumor lysis labs, onc following. Tachycardia
   may be due to high output heart failure from acromegaly, cards,
   neurosurg and endocrine following. Await IGF-1 and TSH levels. Would
   also consider fat pad bx for possible amyloidosis, though it wouldn't
   explain everything. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
