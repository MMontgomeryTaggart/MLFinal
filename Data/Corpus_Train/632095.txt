Chief Complaint:  s/p PEA arrest
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9807**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation.  His wife reports that on the day prior
   to admission he was in his usual state of health without any
   complaints.  He went to bed at 11pm with his CPAP on.  His wife awoke
   at 1:30AM and noted that he had a strange breathing pattern.  She again
   awoke at 2:30 am and noted that he continued to be breathing strangely
   and then made several soft choking noises and stopped breathing.  She
   attempted to awaken him with no response so she called EMS who
   reportedly arrived withing 5-10minutes.
   .
   On EMS arrival he was noted to be in PEA arrest he was given 7mg
   epinephrine, 2mg atropine, 2 amps sodium bicarb, 100mg lidocaine, 300mg
   amiodarone, DCCV x 5.  He was started on amiodarone gtt and dopamine
   gtt.  His pupils were noted to be fixed and dilated by EMS.
   .
   On review of systems, his wife denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
   deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
   surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
   stools. He does not have any recent fevers, chills or rigors.  Cardiac
   review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal
   nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
   .
   In the ED, initial vitals were T34.8 rectal 128/77 HR 122 sinus
   tachycardia RR 18 99% RA.  He had an EKG showing sinus tachycardia and
   a bedside echocardiogram showing hyperdynamic LV function, no wall
   motion abnormalities.  He was started on artic sun protocol however his
   initial temperature was 34 degrees celsius.  He had a head CT which
   showed evidence of global anoxic insult.  He was admitted to the CCU
   for further care.

   No acute fractures.

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
 VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION (VF)
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9807**] is an 80 yo M with PMH of parkinsonism, autonomic
   instability and labile blood pressures admitted to the CCU following
   PEA arrest and resuscitation.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest, unlikely to be from primary cardiac etiology, at this
   time most like due to hypoxia from possible aspiration event given that
   main laboratory abnormality is hypoxia and also with new left sided
   infiltrate.  No evidence of pericardial effusion on echo, no evidence
   of pneumothorax.  No evidence of acute MI on admission.  He does have a
   lactic acidosis, likely [**3-20**] prolonged pea arrest in the field.  He has
   been in sinus tachycardia with occasional 2nd degree heart block type I
   o telemetry since admission.  He was bolused with amiodarone and
   lidocaine in the field and started on an amiodarone gtt by EMS.
   -d/c amiodarone gtt as PEA arrest seems very unlikely to be primary
   cardiac
   -monitor on telemetry
   -on artic sun cooling protocol x18 hours, monitor coagulation profile
   -blood, sputum, urine cultures pending
   .
   # CORONARIES: No evidence of acute ischemia on EKG, no evidence of wall
   motion abnormality on echo on admission.  Cardiac enzymes slightly
   elevated however expected in the setting of several DCCV.
   -trend CE's to peak
   -serial EKG's
   .
   # PUMP: Echocardiogram on admission with hyperdynamic LV in the setting
   of resuscitation with numerous epinephrine boluses.  No evidence of
   wall motion abnormality or major valvular lesions.
   .
   #Hypoxia - Most likely etiology of PEA arrest, still with significant
   AA gradient with PaO2 in the 90's on 100%FIO2.  Unclear etiology at
   this time, possibly [**3-20**] aspiration event given LLL opacity and air
   bronchograms on CXR.  Pulmonary embolus is also a consideration however
   no evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram.
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -will start abx if concern for pneumonia vs pneumonitis
   -consider CTA to eval for PE if remains hypoxic without clear cause
   .
   #Anoxic Brain Injury - head ct on admission with evidence of global
   anoxic injury likely [**3-20**] prolonged PEA arrest of unkown duration.
   -cooling protocol
   -low dose fentanyl/versed advised by cardiac arrest consult in case he
   is in a locked in state even though
   - neurology consult in the am
   -48 hour EEG
   .
   #Lactic acidosis - [**3-20**] PEA arrest and prolonged hypoperfusion, lactate
   trending down now that HD stable.
   -monitor serial lactates
   .
   #Transaminitis - likely [**3-20**] ischemic insult
   -monitor trend
   .
   # Hypotesion/Autonomic Instability - long h/o labile BP and severe
   orthostasis.  He is on numerous doses of midodrine at baseline as well
   as salt tabs.  Per his family it is not unusual for him to have blood
   pressure in the 80's - 90's systolic then up to the 160's in the
   evening.  Anoxic injury likely contributing to labile BP
   -continue midodrine four times daily
   -on dopamine currently to maintain MAP >60
   -monitor urine output
   .
   #Urinary retention - chronic indwelling foley catheter, no evidence of
   infection on UA.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, NGT in place, change to OGT if prolonged intubation,
   replete lytes prn, consider starting tube feeds in the AM
