TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had small bowel movement early this afternoon.  Up to commode 2
   times after that with a lot of straining causing her external
   hemorrhoid to bleed twice.  Still on 5 Liters nasal cannula at 1AM. Put
   out 2 Liters today but still positive 1.3 Liters for length of stay.
   Given another 20mg IV Lasix over night. Changed Zosyn to levofloxacin
   PO this AM, metronidazole to PO as well. Started warfarin, started
   bowel regimen.  Cordis d/c
   -ECHO: The right + left atrium are moderately dilated. Right + Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal, free wall motion is normal (LVEF 60-70%).
   -The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   -Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mitral + Tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   -Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**11-30**] v2008, probably no major change.

   Assessment and Plan
   78F with CAD presenting with abdominal pain and progressing to PEA
   arrest s/p resuscitation, extubated and off pressors.
   .
   # RHYTHM/PEA:  Has chronic history of a-fib (on anticoagulation).
   Patient became asystolic while in ED.  Was coded by ED team and had
   temporary pacer line placed by cardiology fellows.  Pulse/pressure
   returned and patient immediately trasferred to CCU.  In paced rhythm
   with HR of 90.  Unlikely to be due to trauma, pneumothorax, or
   hypovolemia.  Possibilites include PE, AAA, MI, mesenteric ischemia,
   metabolic abnormalities, hypoxia, medication overdose, or acidosis.
   -tele
   -EKG in AM
   -consider permanent pacemaker
   -repeat labs tonight- monitor K+
   -no thrombotic event with CT chest
   -no aneursym, aortic dissection with CT abd
   -ECHO
   .
   #Hypotension: unclear etiology, potentially sepsis, acidosis, aortic
   dissection, hyperkalemia.
   -off pressors
   .
   #Hypoxia: CXR with LLL infiltrate, cardiomegaly, coin lesion in RLL,
   crackles on exam
   - now extubated
   - lasix 20 mg IV x 1
   .
   #Acute renal failure: Baseline Creatinine 1.0, was 2.0 on
   presentation.  Now improving.
   .
   #Leukocytosis: WBC 20.0. [**Month (only) 56**] be from stress of cardiac arrest,
   epinephrine administration, abdominal catastrophe.  Will await CT torso
   and cover broadly with antibiotics.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of CAD s/p CABG in [**3002**]
   -holding aspirin until CT torso
   -atorvastatin 20mg daily
   -EKG
   -ECHO
   -monitor cardiac enzymes
   .
   # PUMP:  History of HTN- patient on carvedilol 25mg PO BID and lasix
   40mg daily
   -will hold BP meds initially while pressures are lower than usual.
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # Anticoagulation- on coumadin 2mg daily for chronic a-fib.
   -hold coumadin tonight given possibility of procedure tomorrow
   .
   # Abdominal pain- felt to be constipation, as other serious pathologies
   less likely.
