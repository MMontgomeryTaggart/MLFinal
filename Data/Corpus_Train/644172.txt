   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old male with history of type II DM, HTN, atrial fibrillation
   on coumadin, s/p two vessel CABG in [**2745**] and s/p nephrectomy admitted
   to the CCU for evaluation of dyspnea following diagnostic cath.
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has EF of 35-40% on TTE yesterday.  Most likely
   the patient had an episode of dyspnea secondary to volume overload from
   pre-cath hydration, fluid during the procedure, and possibly flash
   pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension.  Much improved after
   minimal diuresis.  Nitro gtt weaned o/n.
   - Home antihypertensive medications started this morning (Imdur 90mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and Verapamil 120mg [**Hospital1 **], Losartan on hold given ARF - can change to
   hydralazine PO for afterload reduction if ARF does not improve)
   -Restart home dose of lasix 40mg TID in AM
   - Monitor I/Os, daily weights; goal even today
   - Restart home Digoxin today, as Cr stable this AM
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of two vessel CABG with
   possible presentation of changing/unstable angina over the past 6
   months.  On diagnostic cath today found to have RCA diffuse disease as
   well as high grade stenosis of the SVG to Diag.  Intervention planned
   for the end of the week once heart failure stable.
   - Continue ASA 325mg given possible unstable angina
   - Continue atorvastatin 80mg
   - Mucomyst x2 doses today following cath
   - Restart home Losartan this AM as Cr stable
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of A fib, sick sinus syndrome,
   atrial flutter s/p cardioversion, SVT with question of pre-excitation
   bypass tract and pacemaker placement.  Currently, the patient is paced.
   - Continue amiodarone, disopyramide, metoprolol for rate control
   - Unclear why the patient was taking propanolol as well as metoprolol,
   will hold for now
   - Given renal dysfunction will hold digoxin and restart when renal
   function returns to baseline.
   - The patient was instructed to hold coumadin in the setting of cath,
   will continue to hold until repeat catheterization
   - Restart Digoxin as above
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure:  The patient is s/p nephrectomy for renal cell
   carcinoma.  Previous baseline creatinine 1.4, last week Crn 2.3 -
   likely this is new baseline.  Unclear if new baseline is secondary to
   Type 2 DM, however likely decreased perfusion in the context of flash
   pulmonary edema.
   -Follow creatinine; stable today
   -FeNa if no improvement with diuresis
   .
   # Patient should have outpatient sleep study.
   .
   # Type 2 DM:  Continue Insulin sliding scale PRN.  FS BG QID.  Pt is on
   a lower dose than his home insulin regimen, will likely need to
   uptitrate regimen.
   -Losartan re-initiated today as above
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue atorvastatin (exchange for fluvastatin),
   ezetimide, and fish oil.
   .
   # Hypertension: stable.  Continue out-pt meds, consider out-pt sleep
   study.
   .
   # COPD:  Currently no wheezing on exam, unlikely to have contributed to
   the patient's respiratory distress earlier.  Wean O2 as tolerated.
   Continue spiriva, nebs PRN.
   .
   # Inner [**Last Name **] problem:  Continue meclizine and valium.
   .
   # GERD:  Continue Mylanta PRN and ranitidine

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 6072**], [**Doctor Last Name 3729**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   68 year old man with CAD s/p CABG [**45**]', distal RCA BMS 99', ischemic
   myopathy with EF 35-40%, sick sinus s/p PPM, obesity, AF/flutter,
   nephrectomy secondary to RCCA 89', htn admitted post-cardiac
   catheterization for respiratory distress. Patient with 6 month history
   of progressive dyspnea on exertion and throat discomfort with minimal
   exertion. Stress test (report not received) apparently demonstrated
   inferior wall ischemia for which he was referred for cardiac
   catheterization. After diagnostic portion (LIMA-LAD patent, SVG-OM with
   2 tandem lesions) patient developed hypoxemia, progressive respiratory
   distress and hypertension for which he was given morphine, lasix (160
   mg IV total), started on NTG gtt (120 mg) with improvement in
   respiratory status. Currently comfortable and denies shortness of
   breath, chest/jaw/neck discomfort, or orthopnea/PND overnight. TTE
   yesterday demonstrated dilated left ventricle, mild MR, anterior and
   septal hypokinesis, and probable inferior hk (ef 35-40%) with mild
   pulmonary hypertension. Findings are similar to echo report noted in
   patient's outpatient notes from Dr.[**Name (NI) 9327**] office.
   Physical Examination
   BP 125/55, HR 70 (paced), ~1.5 L negative/24 hours.
   per housestaff note
   Medical Decision Making
   1. CAD, CABG, prior RCA stent: planned stenting of SVG-OM serial
   stenoses. Patient had episode of pulmonary edema during procedure
   likely due to hydration protocol for renal protection in the setting of
   depressed ejection fraction. Now appears comfortable with preserved
   oxygen saturation and normal blood pressure. Plan for repeat attempt at
   intervention likely Thursday, if patient in agreement.
   On extensive medical regimen for CAD, managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4505**]. Will
   need mucomyst administration again if catheterization planned.
   Attempting to obtain outpatient stress test done 2 weeks ago.
   2. Cardiomyopathy: not markedly volume overloaded currently, although
   filling pressures high. On [**Last Name (un) **], furosemide, beta-blocker.
   3. AF: in chronic AF with paced ventricular rhythm. Anticoagulated
   chronically. Unclear why patient still on amiodarone given persistent
   AF. Will defer to outpatient cardiologist.
   4. ?Sleep disordered breathing: would recommend outpatient sleep study
   given probable sleep apnea (by history). Will increase
   morbidity/mortality of CAD and CM if left untreated.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **], Giurseffi, [**Doctor Last Name 6072**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 35 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Critical care required because of close montoring due to acute
   respiratory failure during procedure.
