Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   49yo man with a h/o HIV on IDDM, HTN, schistosomiasis, Serratia
   infections with bacteremia requiring 6 weeks of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 1809**]-[**Doctor Last Name 108**]
   tear ([**7-19**]) HAART (last CD4 500) and ESRD on HD, PE on Warfarin, who
   was noted to have rigors, a fever of 102 in the setting of some
   discharge from his tunneled line. The line site was swabbed and sent
   for culture, and sent blood cultures as well.  He received Vanc and
   Tylenol. In the ED he was afebrile and tachycardic to 130 with normal
   BP.  He was bolused 1.5 liters of NS. He underwent a CT abdomen /
   pelvis without acute abnormalities. Blood cultures (4 out of 4) grew
   out CNS. He received Zosyn. Cardiology was consulted for an isoloated
   ST elevated in V2.

   Assessment and Plan
   49yo man with a h/o HIV on IDDM, HTN, schistosomiasis, Serratia
   infections with bacteremia requiring 6 weeks of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 1809**]-[**Doctor Last Name 108**]
   tear ([**7-19**]) HAART (last CD4 500) and ESRD on HD, PE on Warfarin, who
   was noted to have rigors, a fever of 102 in the setting of some
   discharge from his tunneled line.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   The most likley source of his fevers is a line infection given it
s in
   the setting of a purulent line and there is no other obvious source. He
   is undergoing a TTE today to ensure that there is no seeding or
   component of endocarditis (which seems unlikely but warrants
   evaluation.) He is currently being
treated through
 rather than
   d/c
ing his line given his access is very limited (he has multiple
   clots throughout. He is to go for bilateral uper extremity U/Ss to
   further delineate his vasculature. Will await the sensitivities of his
   CNS and continue Vanc for the time being.
 ESRD
   He undergoes dialysis on MWF. Continue Vanc with HD as mentioned above.
   Access issues as above.
 HISTORY OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   He is on a heparin gtt as we hold his Warfarin while determining the
   plan for his HD line.
 ISOLATED ST ELEVATION
   Troponins are up but this is in the setting of his ESRD and being
   post-HD. Will recheck an EKG this morning and follow-up his enzymes
   which are pending. Doubt that this represents a plaque rupture.
 ISOLATED ST ELEVATION
   HIV on HAART.
