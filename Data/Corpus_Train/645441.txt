   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old man with history of CAD, syncope and ventricular
   tachycardia transferred from the [**Hospital1 1859**] service for one minute of
   polymorphic VT vs. torsades.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Recent hx of torsades vs. polymorphic VT, during which time
   the patient was unresponsive and CPR was administered for 1 minute, no
   shocks were administered.  The patient was given IV mag on first
   evaluation.  Troponins negative to date.  No o/n events.  Suspect
   ischemic etiology of his arrhythmia at this time given his extensive
   coronary disease.
   -continue telemetry, amiodarone if needed for ventricular arrhythmia
   - Monitor on telemetry overnight
   - Will use Amiodarone only if becomes unstable given plan for EP study
   - Continue metoprolol.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  S/p stent placement to the mid and proximal circ.
   -continue aspirin/plavix
   - Continue medical management with aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril and
   atorvastatin.
   .
   #. PUMP:  Recent Echo did not show evidence of systolic function or
   major valvular disorders.  Continue to monitor I/Os and daily weights.
   - Prevention with metoprolol and lisinopril
   - repeat echo today, eval systolic funx
   .
   #. Hypertension: Continue home metoprolol and lisinopril.
   .
   #. Hyplerlipidemia:  Continue atorvastatin.  Most recent lipids are
   from [**6-/3052**] LDL was 84 and HDL 56.
   .
   # Constipation: pt without BM since Saturday.  Will start
   senna/docusate today.
