TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2601-8-1**] 07:59 PM
   [**2601-8-1**]: Started Metoprolol 25 TID. Around 8pm Pt tacchy to 130s,
   dyspeneic. O2 requirement increased from 2 to 4L. EKG obtained showed
   afib. Given 50 of metoprolol. Ordered 15 IV Dilt but held it as HR came
   down to 80s.  CXR shows increased pulmonary edema. Pt urinating well so
   held off on diuretics.
   ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
   depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to akinesis of the basal septum and
   hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. There is considerable
   beat-tobeat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due
   to an irregular rhythm. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
   moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA)
 PULMONARY EDEMA
   78 y/o gentleman with CAD with PCI in [**2598**], HTN, AS, AF, presents with
   rest angina in the setting of rapid heart rate with wide complex
   tachycardia.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Chest pain is concerning for unstable angina.  Known CAD
   as above. Plan is for cath early next week to fix underlying CAD, to
   allow for possible catheter ablation of VT. CK leak is likely due to
   demand ischemia.
   - cycle CE
   - ASA 325, plavix 75 (already loaded in ED)
   - heparin gtt when INR is below 2 and will hold coumadin
   - Will increase BB if HR trends up
   - risk stratify with HbA1c and lipid panel
   - continuing statin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Episodes of WCT concerning for VTach.  Now in afib with PVC.
   Vt is in RVOT or LVOT in location
   - rate control with BB
   - heparin gtt and will hold coumadin
   - will start amiodarone gtt if WCT returns
   .
   # PUMP:  Known severe AS in our system and currently on exam.  Cath in
   [**2597**] with [**Location (un) 534**] of 1.07 with gradient of 21 mmHg.
   - daily I&O and weights
   - may benefit from careful diuresis in AM given CHF
   .
   #  ARF:  Cr 1.3 on admission.  Last Cr in our system is 0.9 in [**2597**].
   - trend Cr/renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins.
   - will get renal US given abd bruit
   .
   #  Medication reconciliation:
   - Unable to reach his family or pharmacy ([**Company 8650**] in [**Hospital1 696**])
   - will perform in AM.
   .
   #  Cough:  Patient states that this is similar to his allergic
   symptoms.  No fever.  CXR without evidence of PNA.  WBC mild elevation
   could be secondary to stress.
   - trend fever curve
   - low thresh hold to repeat CXR with PA/Lat
   .
   FEN:  Cardiac heart healthy
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's

   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with therap INR
