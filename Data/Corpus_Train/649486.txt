   Initial visit, Cardiology service: CCU
   Presenting complaint: Arrhythmia
   History of present illness: 53-year-old woman with history of atrial
   fibrillation presented after having v-fib arrest. At her nursing home
   this morning she was found down. EMS was called, finding her to be in
   v-fib. She received shocks x 3, 6 mg total of epinephrine, 300 mg
   loading dose of amiodarone then drip. Intubated in the field. She was
   transported to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where she was given 1 unit of pRBCs. Guaiac
   reportedly negative. Got a total of 2.5 L of NS. Started on Artic Sun
   before med flight to [**Hospital1 1**].
   .
   On arrival to the [**Hospital1 1**] ED, she was found cold with 8mm fixed pupils
   bilaterally and no response to stimuli. SBP was in the 140s-160s
   without pressor, HR 50s-60s. ECG showed... She got a head CT and chest
   CTA. Transferred to CCU for further management.
   .
   Of note, patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2718-8-21**] to [**2718-8-26**] for
   syncope and runs of VT. Prior to this admission, OSH ETT had shown
   possible mild basal inferior ischemia vs. attenuation artifact with
   overall normal systolic function. She underwent cardiac
   catheterization, which showed a 90% distal RCA stenosis, and a DES was
   placed in the RCA. TTE and TEE showed a large (21 mm) secundum atrial
   septal defect with LVEF>55%. Review of her strip rhythm suggested that
   her arrhythmia may be atrial in origin rather than ventricular
   tachycardia. For that reason, she underwent an EP study on [**2718-8-23**],
   which included ventricular stimulation as well as assessment for atrial
   arrhythmias.  She was found to have inducible atrial flutter, that was
   typical counter clockwise flutter and she had a successful isthmus
   ablation. She had no sustained ventricular tachycardia with ventricular
   stimulation protocol. She was evaluated by the cardiac surgeons as well
   as the interventional cardiologists for percutaneous surgical closure
   of her large secundum ASD, and it was deemed that this should be done
   as an outpatient. In addition, with her history of significant atrial
   arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation, it was thought that a pulmonary
   vein isolation procedure would be beneficial prior to any closure of
   her secundum ASD.

   Tests
   ECG: (Date: [**2718-11-14**]), sinus with 1-1 AV conduction, rate 73 bpm, nl
   axis, left atrial enlargement, RBBB, no ST/T changes, no Q
   Echocardiogram: (Date: [**2718-8-22**]), The left atrium is dilated. The right
   atrium is moderately dilated. A right-to-left shunt across the
   interatrial septum is seen at rest. A secundum type atrial septal
   defect is present. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
   ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly
   dilated with borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal
   septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
   mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Secundum ASD with significant right to left shunting at
   rest. The right ventricle is dilated, borderline hypokinetic with
   evidence of pressure/volume overload. Moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   Cardiac Cath: (Date: [**2718-8-22**]), 1. Coronary angiography in this right
   dominant system demonstrated single vessel disease.  The LMCA had no
   angiographically apparent
   disease.  The LAD and LCx had minor lumenal irregularities.  The large
   RCA had a 90% stenosis of the distal vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics revealed a significant atrial shunt, consistent
   with either a patent foramen ovale or an atiral septal defect, with
   Qp/Qs=2.7.  There were elevated right and left sided filling pressures
   with RVEDP of 13 mmHg and LVEDP of 27 mmHg.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension wwith PASP of 50mmHg.  There
   was mild systolic arterial hypertension wiht SBP of 158 mmHg and DBP
   72mmHg. There was no evidence of aortic or mitral stenosis.
   3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the RCA with a 2.5x13mm Cypher stent
   that was postdilated to 3.0. Final angiography revealed no residual
   stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow
   (see PTCA comments).
   4. Successful deployment of 6F Perclose Proglide closure device.
   Assessment and Plan
   63-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter presented
   after v-fib arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Rhythm now in sinus.
   - Artic Sun protocol
   - continue ventilatory support
   - 48h continous EEG
   - HOB > 30
   - f/u head CT final read
   - f/u chest CTA final read
   .
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2718-7-31**].
   - telemetry
   - continue ASA, clopidogrel
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 120s-150s. EF >55% in [**2718-7-31**].
   - echo in a.m.
   - monitor BP
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, now in sinus. Was initially in vfib then asystole.
   Unclear precipitant.
   - continue warfarin
   - telemetry
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine
