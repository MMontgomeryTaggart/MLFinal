Chief Complaint:  Unresponsiveness
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3681**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS, and DM 2
   transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness. The patient was initially
   admitted to an OSH for unresponsiveness and slurred speech that
   spontaneously resolved. At that time, he denied any chest pain, but
   does endorse dyspnea with exertion and occasional exertional chest pain
   when walking from his bed to the bathroom.  At the OSH, the patient had
   a CTH that was negative and carotid dopplers that demonstrated severe
   bilateral carotid stenosis. He was also noted to have a right foot
   ulcer for which he received amp/sulbactam and was transfused 1 unit
   pRBCs on the morning of [**2583-11-9**] for a hemoglobin of 10.0.  Of note,
   the patient was scheduled for an outpatient revascularization procedure
   of the RLE on [**2583-11-11**] prior to this admission.
   .
   On initial arrival, the patient was noted to be mildly fluid overloaded
   and noted that he had increased lower extremity edema for the past 2
   weeks. A CXR demonstrated mild pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary
   vascular congestion with a BNP of 2200.  This morning, the patient was
   found to be unresponsive. On initial exam, he was noted to have
   convulsions, which were not tonic-clonic in nature.  ABG on 2L nc
   7.40/62/91 and the patient received 40 mg IV lasix.  He regained
   consciousness within minutes, although remained confused and unable to
   follow commands for several minutes without any stool incontinence (FC
   in place).
   .
   Currently, he is resting comfortably without complaints. Denies CP/SOB,
   f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA, palpitations, diaphoresis, or pain
   radiating to jaw or arm.

   Imaging: 2.STENOSES IDENTIFIED INVOLVING THE MAJOR BRANCH VESSELS OF
   THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. I SUSPECT MODERATE STENOSIS OF THE ORIGINS OF THE
   SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY AND THE CELIAC ARTERY. ADDITIONALLY I
   SUSPECT MILD NARROWING OF THE ORIGIN OF THE RIGHT RENAL ARTERY AND MILD
   TO MODERATE NARROWING ON THE LEFT SIDE. ALL FOUR VESSELS DO OPACIFY
   WELL DISTAL TO THE PROXIMAL NARROWINGS.
   3.EVIDENCE OF PORTAL HYPERTENSION. THERE IS AN OBVIOUS VARICOSITY
   CONNECTING FROM THE DISTAL SPLENIC VEIN TO THE INFERIOR VENA CAVA.
   4.CONSOLIDATION ATELECTASIS INVOLVING LEFT LOWER LOBE. CLINICAL
   CORRELATION RECOMMENDED.
   .
   Cardiac Cath [**2583-8-25**]:
   1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system demonstrated one
   vessel disease. The LMCA had mild disease, but no flow-limiting
   stenosis. The LAD was proximally occluded. The LCx had mild disease.
   The RCA was small and had mild disease; it also provided collateral
   flow to the LAD via the conus.
   2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a slightly elevated left-sided
   filling pressure of 15mmHg. The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   within normal limits.
   3. There was mild aortic stenosis with a mean peak to peak gradient of
   28 mmHg.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease with proximal LAD occlusion.
   2. Mild aortic stenosis.
   .
   Echo [**2583-8-25**]:
   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left ventricular wall
   motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
   (EF>75%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or
   with Valsalva. No mid-cavitary gradient is identified. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters
   of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
   represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   regional and global systolic function. Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   ECG: Sinus with 1:1 conduction. LBBB. NI. TWI in V1-V3 new compared to
   [**2583-8-25**].
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3681**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS, and DM 2
   transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness: Most likely etioloigy at this time is LLL collapse
   leading to transient hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive
   disease with supple/demand mismatch.  This may also represent a TIA
   from embolic source, although less likely.  From an obstructive lung
   disease standpoint, he appears to be at baseline with minimal wheezing
   and an ABG on 2L nc with appropriate pH and compensatory metabolic
   compensation in setting of chronic CO2 retention. Additionally, this
   may represent new seizure activity, although patient does not have a
   history of seizure activity. Prior to transfer to CCU, [**Hospital1 1246**] team
   already consulted neurology for possible TIA and/or seizure.
   - Chest PT, mucolytics
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Non-contrast CTH and CTA neck
   - Follow-up neurology recs
   - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
   .
   # Carotid stenosis: Patient transferred for carotid intervention.
   - As above, CTA neck to assess carotid and basilar flow.
   - Continue ASA 81 and atorvastatin.
   - Continue to hold coumadin, plan to start heparin in AM when INR<2
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient with known COPD on supplemental overnight O2,
   although this appears to be stable. Based on physical exam, admission
   CXR, and elevated BNP, he likely also has an element of volume overload
   secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  In addition, he was noted to
   have elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization in [**8-7**].
   Patient received lasix 40 IV this AM.  CXR following unresponsiveness
   now with LLL collapse.
   - Lasix prn with goal TBB -1000 cc/day. Check PM lytes.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Chest PT and mucolytics as above.
   .
   # CAD: Patient not currently complaining of chest pain or anginal
   equivalents.  ECG with new TWI, although low suspicion for ACS at this
   time.
   - Continue metoprolol, ASA, statin, imdur.
   .
   # Pump: Patient with preserved LVEF on last echo, although with signs
   of volume overload currently.
   - Continue metoprolol, lasix as above.
   .
   # Rhythmn: Sinus with 1:1 conduction.
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear baseline, although patient received 1 unit PRBC at
   OSH prior to transfer for hemoglobin 10.  Patient with iron studies
   consistent with iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   - Guaiac stools
   - Call PCP and assess colonoscopy history.
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism: Patient with history of PE in [**6-7**] on coumadin.
   Unclear based on review of records if there was an inciting event and
   need for continued anticoagulation.
   - Until clarified, will cover with heparin gtt for INR<2, although
   patient may not require continued anticoagulation.
   .
   # DM: Hold home glipizide. Continue HISS and accuchecks.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now pending improvement in mental status. NPO at midnight.
   Replete as necessary.
   Access: PIV
   PPx: Therapeutic INR, heparin gtt with subtherapeutic as above.
   Code: DNR/DNI confirmed on admission.  Will plan on reversing prior to
   interventions.
   Dispo: ICU level of care.
