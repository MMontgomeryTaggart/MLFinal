   Assessment and Plan
   75 [**Hospital 5228**] nursing home resident, COPD, now with CAP/HCAP and sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to pneumonia and
   component of pulmomary edema (cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic).
   Pneumonia may be precipitant.  Stable following extubation.  Monitor
   ABG, SaO2.
   COPD -- optimize medications, including steroids, antimicrobials.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- suspect attributable predominately to
   pneumonia , and component of CHF (underlying cardiomyopathy).
   Empirical antimicrobials.  Monitor CXR.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Responded to iv fluid bolus yesterday,
   allowing discontinuation of vasoopressor.  Attributed to sepsis,
   hypovolemia, contribution of PEEP.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of adrenal
   insufficiency (stress dose steroids).  s/p fluid resussitation.
   Maintain vasopressor, aim MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- resolved.
   ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY -- taper steroids to baseline dose.
   CHF -- underlying cardiomyopathy, EF 15-25 %.  Monitor for evidence for
   overt CHF.
   FLUIDS -- net volume expanded following resussitation.  Plan monitor
   I/O, maintain balance.  IV fluid bolus as needed to maintain BP.  D/C
   central line, maintain PICC.
   COAGULOPATHY -- improved INR following vitamin K and while holding
   coumadin; elevation  likely reflect nutrition and drug-effect (ex.
   Levofloxicin).  Consider FFP (or coumadin) if INR continues to rise.
   Consider substituting Levofloxicin.  Monitor coags.
   h/o PULMONARY EMBOLI -- continue chronic anticoagulation once INR in
   therapeutic range.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF if remains intubated.
