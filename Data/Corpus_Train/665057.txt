   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**3204**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1465**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**3216-11-9**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2222**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**11-12**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**2-8**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**11-10**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**2-8**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - on levophed
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**2-8**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 364**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**5-11**] on [**11-12**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**2-8**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**2-10**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - given 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.  Progressively worsening, Cr
   now > 4.
   - follow urine outputs
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**2-8**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis. CT abd is benign.
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**2-8**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**2-8**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   - hold advair while intubated
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**2-8**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   - vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   - cont wound care
   - cont pneumoboots
   .
   # Hematuria: Apparently started in setting of fall that caused trauma
   to foley.  CBI was d/ced, currently resolved.
   .
   # Anxiety: Apparently started in setting of son's diagnosis of cancer.
   Had been with poor appetite. Patient to be intubated.
   - readdress when more stable
   - hold amytriptilline
   .
   # FEN: patient received 1 L NS, follow and replete [**Hospital1 **] elytes
   .
   # ACCESS: 1PIV and 1EJ
   .
   #PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -Pain management with fentanyl
   -Bowel regimen with colace/senna
   -VAP bundle
   -PPI
