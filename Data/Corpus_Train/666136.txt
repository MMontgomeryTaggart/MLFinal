   TITLE: CCU Staff Note
   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   53 year old woman with CAD s/p DES to dRCA in 7.09, large secundum ASD
   (Qp/Qs 2.7), Aflutter s/p ablation, atrial fibrillation, who is s/p VF
   arrest on 10.15 with severe anoxic encephalopathy (s/p cooling
   protocol). Course complicated by status epilepticus, fever, probable
   pneumonia (possibly aspiration).
   Events:
   MRI brain 10.19 demonstrated
diffuse anoxic cerebral injury
 pattern
   which portends a poor prognosis.
   Evoked potentials demonstrated no cortical activity.
   Family meeting occurred late yesterday (with neurology and palliative
   care)  to discuss poor prognosis.
   Physical Examination
   Per housestaff note
   Medical Decision Making
   Cardiac arrest secondary to VF, anoxic encephalopathy; s/p cooling
   protocol without neurologic recovery:
   Given findings of evoked potential testing and MRI, the likelihood of
   no meaningful recovery discussed with family in detail.
   Brother opted to withdraw care and allow patient to expire, which he
   feels is what she would wish.
   Patient was extubated and feeding tube/all medications discontinued.
   Palliative care following patient closely with social work support.
   She appears comfortable without distress, on morphine and
   anticholinergics.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 3042**], [**Doctor Last Name 3089**], [**Location (un) **],
   [**Last Name (LF) 8638**], [**First Name3 (LF) 2454**].
