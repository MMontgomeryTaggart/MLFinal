   Assessment and Plan
   63 year old woman with severe diastolic heart failure, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation presenting with decompensated heart failure in the
   setting of medication non compliance, admitted to CCU for initiation of
   ultrafiltration.
   # ACUTE DECOMPENSATED DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient not responding
   to intravenous diuretics, now day 2 of ultrafiltration for diuresis.
   Etiology of diastolic dysfunction unknown: consider infiltrative
   disease especially with evidence of nephrotic range proteinuria (see
   below)
   -- continue UF
   -- d/c diuretics while pt receiving CVVHD, goal is to remove fluid as
   BP tolerates
   -- TTE repeated, no significant change from the last echo, no evidence
   of amyloidosis.
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD
   - ASA 81mg
   # RHYTHM: Pt with a-fib. Not on anti-coagulation given history of
   severe GI bleed.  Has significant bradycardia, although asymptomatic
   no confusion, dizziness, chest pain
   - continue to hold b blocker
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Pt with baseline 1.2-1.4. On
   admission 1.8 and increased to 2.1 with diuresis and poor forward
   flow.  However, patient only with minimal urine output with lasix gtt
   and metolazone. Started on UF for volume removal.  U/A with nephrotic
   range proteinuria and significant edema.  No hyperlipidemia and SPEP
   and UPEP without monoclonal spike.  Possible etiologies include
   amyloidosis (unlikely with negative UPEP), multiple myeloma, minimal
   change disease, other causes glomerular nephrosis. Cr currently at
   baseline
 1.3.
   -- f/u renal recs
   -- renal U/S
 no hydronephrosis, limited study
   -- avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   # UC: Patient w/ hx of Ulcerative Colitis. Pt with loose stools.
   - cont mesalamine 800mg TID
   - guaiac stools
   #. Anemia: Hct 23, stable. Likely combination of anemia [**2-7**] renal
   failure and possible GI loss given prior history.
   - active T&S
   - monitor Hct
   - guaiac stools
   FEN: Cardiac/ replace prn
   ACCESS: PIV's, a-line  temp CVVH line
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sq
   -Pain management oxycodone q 4hrs prn
