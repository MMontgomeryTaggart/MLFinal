TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  chest pain
   HPI:
   Please see the CT surgery admission note and Cardiology consult H&P for
   full details.
   In brief, this is a 64yo M w/CAD s/p CABG X 3 who presented to an OSH
   with chest pain that began after shoveling snow on [**2783-2-16**].  He
   describes the pain as a sharp sensation below his right lower rib. He
   took 2 NTG tablets without effect and presented to [**Location (un) 10683**] (NH)
   Hospital where biomarkers were positive (peak Tn 2.4, CKMB 10.8, CK
   147). He underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a patent vein
   graft to the LAD with the remaining grafts and native vessels occluded
   or severely diseased. Following the procedure he had persistent chest
   pain despite high dose nitro gtt. He was felt not to be a candidate for
   re-do bypass by the surgeon at the OSH. An intraaortic balloon pump was
   placed and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 17**] under for evaluation by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1895**]. On arrival to the CCU, he continued to c/o CP but soon
   thereafter became pain free on a heparin gtt, integrilin and a nitro
   gtt.  He was evaluated by CT surgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7030**] and was transferred
   to the CCU service on [**2782-2-19**] to proceed with
   .
   Family reports he developed slurred speech 3 days ago the day prior to
   the onset of his chest pain. Denied motor deficits or disorientation.
   Of note, he had run out of his oxycodone for several days.  He has had
   chronic anterior chest pain as a result of his repeated sternotomies
   for which he takes oxycodone x 10 years.
   .
   On cardiac review of symptoms, cardiac and musculoskeletal chest pain
   as above. No PND, orthopnea, DOE, [**Location (un) **].

   Imaging:
   CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2783-2-18**] at [**Location (un) 10683**] Hospital: patent SVG-LAD,
   LMCA 80% distal stenosis, LAD occluded at midportion, LCx proximally
   occluded, RCA occluded, SVG->OM/Diag not able to be engaged despite use
   of JR4, [**Last Name (LF) 12360**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] or [**Doctor First Name **].
   .
   ECHO [**2783-2-19**]:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
   normal/borderline dilated with focal hypokinesis of the distal septum.
   The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall
   contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
   regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
   enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Focal left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   ECG: ECG [**2783-2-18**]: SR 64 bpm. Q III, small avF. t wave flattening III,
   avL, avF. Unchanged from EKG [**2783-2-17**] from OSH
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12373**] is a 64M with severe CAD s/p CABG x 3. He is not a surgical
   candidate per CT surgery.
   .
   1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: pt with CAD s/p CABG x 3.  Currently chest
   pain free on nitro, heparin, IABP in place.
   - pt with severe 3V disease with 1 graft patent
   - per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7030**], plan for intervention on monday
   - continue nitro gtt, heparin gtt, IABP
   - integrillin off (was on for 24 hours)
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID as tolerated by BP and HR
   - high dose statin, ASA
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7030**] to review cath films for potential catheter-based
   intervention
   .
   2. PUMP: ECHO with distal septal hypokinesis, EF 55%. Appears euvolemic
   on exam without evidence of failure.
   - continue to assess fluid status
   - holding ACE for now given catheterization
   .
   3. RHYTHM: sinus
   .
   4. DIABETES:
   - check HBA1C
   - hold glyburide, metformin while in house
   - HISS
   .
   5. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA:
   - high dose statin
   - continue gemfibrizol, zetia
   - lipid panel in AM
   .
   6. FEN: cardiac/diabetic diet
   .
   7. PPx: IV heparin, colace
   .
   8. Code Status: FULL
