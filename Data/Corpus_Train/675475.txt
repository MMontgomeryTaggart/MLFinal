   Assessment and Plan
   85yoF history of aortic stenosis, afib; with hypoxemia and dyspnea.
   1.       Hypoxemia:  Likely pulmonary edema, possibly in setting of
   infectious process.
   - Continue management of her hemodynamics
   - diuresis
   - decrease O2 as tolerated
   2.       PNA:
   - little evidence for significant PNA
   - Plan to treat with course of levofloxacin; d/c ceftriaxone
   - f/u flu swab; d/c oseltamivir if DFA negative
   3.       CV:  h/o moderate AS
   - Repeat TTE
   - beta-blocker
   - restart home regimen
