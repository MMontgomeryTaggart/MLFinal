   RUQ U/S:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Diffusely coarsened echotexture of the liver. No discrete nodule
   seen;
   however, evaluation is limited given the coarsened appearance of the
   liver.
   Multiphasic CT or MRI is more sensitive for detecting focal
   intrahepatic
   lesions and can be considered for further evaluation if indicated.
   2. Collapsed gallbladder with sludge and gallstones.
   Assessment and Plan
   68 M with CAD s/p 5 stents, chronic systolic heart failure, atrial
   fibrillation, moderate AS, PVD, pHTN, h/o melanoma s/p resection and
   radiation, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease presents from [**Hospital **] with symptomatic bradycardia and acute on chronic kidney
   failure
   .
   # Bradycardia
 DDx includes tachy/brady syndrome with excessive beta
   blockade, new MI/ischemia, metastatic damage to conduction system
   - ruled out for MI x 3
   - holding amiodarone and BB for now
   - per EP, will go for pacer placement
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney failure- patient has been NPO for past [**3-16**]
   days while still receiving his furosemide and [**Last Name (un) **]. Had urinalysis at
   [**Location (un) 190**] with no RBCs and slight proteinuria not consistent with
   nephritic picture. Patient is not volume overloaded on exam, in fact he
   appears slightly volume depleted.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] and diuretics
   - given normal saline at 75cc/hr for 1500cc
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # GIB - patient with long history of recurrent GIB which is why he is
   off ASA and warfarin. Has continued with clopidogrel as sole therapy.
   Of note his last stent was placed 5 years ago. He had a SB capsule
   study at [**Hospital1 571**] facility in [**Location (un) **] several months ago with 'ulcers' in
   small bowel and last 3 days at [**Location (un) 190**] he has had EGD with gastric non
   bleeding ulcers and colonoscopy with no signs of active bleeding. He
   was transfused 3 units PRBC over past week and has been having chronic
   melena for months now.
   - Hct remains stable, continue to trend esp. if continued evidence of
   GIB
   - active type and screen
   - 2 large bore PIV
   .
   # Transaminitis- ddx includes hypoperfusion, medication induced from
   amiodarone, metastatic disease, fatty liver. Less likely hepatitis.
   - recheck and trend
   - hold amiodarone
   - tox panel negative
   - IVF to restore euvolemia
   - RUQ US: coarse echotexture of liver, no appreciable nodularity though
   limited exam
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure- currently volume depleted
   - hold BB, diuretic and [**Last Name (un) **] for now given acute issues
   - normal saline 75cc/hr for 1500cc
   - daily weights
   .
   # h/o melanoma- stage III followed by oncology. Not a candidate for
   interferon given CAD
   .
   # OSA- CPAP
   .
   FEN:  NPO for now
   .
