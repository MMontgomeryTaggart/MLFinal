   Assessment and Plan
   73 yr old male w/ COPD, HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, h/o silent [**Hospital **]
   transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after LAD perforation found to have
   dissection of the mid LAD, thrombosis of his stent and small
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with 100% occlusion of his LAD. Attempted intervention
   was complicated by mid LAD dissection.  Upon transfer for covered stent
   placement he subsequently thrombosed his stent. No further attempts at
   PCI given the perforation complication. Pt with CP that is not similar
   to his angina, but consistent with pericardial irritation.  Small
   effusion seen on ECHO w/o tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was performed,
   but no fluid was removed. Pt hemodynamically stable and CP improving.
   - closely monitor hemodynamics and signs of worsening effusion. If
   worsens will need to return to cath lab for pericardiocentesis
