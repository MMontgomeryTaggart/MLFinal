[**2497-4-24**] ECHO
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 902**] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being a paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. The thoracic aorta appears
intact. No changes from the prebypass study.
Radiology Report CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of
[**2497-4-27**]
Final Report
HISTORY: CABG. PICC line placement.
There is increased density in the retrocardiac area consistent
with
atelectasis or consolidation. The costophrenic sulci are
blunted.
Mediastinal structures are unchanged. A right internal jugular
sheath remains in place. A PICC line has been inserted on the
left and terminates at the level of the cavoatrial junction.
Compared with the previous study
retrocardiac density has increased and blunting of the
costophrenic sulci is new or more apparent.
IMPRESSION: PICC placement as described. Increased atelectasis
or
consolidation in the lower left lung. Evidence for small pleural
effusions.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 110**] was a same day admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2497-4-24**] for
coronary artery bypass grafting. She was taken to the operating
room where she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to
three vessels. Please see operative note for details.
In summary she had: Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to
the first obtuse marginal coronary artery; reverse saphenous
vein single graft from the aorta to the posterior left
ventricular coronary artery.
Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting.
Her bypass time was 78 minutes with a crossclamp time of 63
minutes.
She tolerated the operation well and post-operatively she was
transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. In the
immediate post-op period she remained hemodynamically stable,
she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated.
Because the patient is a type 1 diabetic followed by the [**Last Name (un) 383**]
diabetes service they were consulted for assistance in her care
and insulin management. The patient stayed in the ICU for 3
additional days because she required a Phenylephrine infusion to
support her blood pressure. On POD4 she transferred out of the
ICU to the stepdown floor for continued care and recovery from
her surgery. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed.
She was seen by physical therapy and her activity was advanced.
The remainder of her hospital course ws uneventful. On POD6 the
patient was discharged home with visiting nurses. she is to
follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 902**] in 4 weeks.
