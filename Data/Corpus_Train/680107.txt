   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 yo F with CAD s/p 3V CABG and critical aortic stenosis.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG. However, no evidence of
   ACS (negative troponins, no new ischemic EKG changes). Patient's chest
   pain likely demand ischemia in setting of critical AS and  hypertensive
   emergency.
   - continue ASA 325 mg PO daily and zetia 10mg daily
   - start short acting metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, goal HR 55-60
   - will restart losartan today
   - treatment of hypertension (see below)
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive emergency. Patient grossly hypertensive in
   the cath lab with arterial tracings showing systolics in the 330s. BP
   brought down by nitroprusside gtt overnight in the CCU to SBPs 200.
   Likely chronically hypertensive in setting of medication non-compliance
   due to financial issues. Outpt blood pressure checks have SBPs ranging
   from 110s-140s, but were in the left arm with known L subclavian steal
   phenomenon. Also, cuff pressure seems to underestimate the true BPs
   that are measured via A-line.
   - transition nitroprusside gtt to metoprolol and losartan today
   - has arterial sheath in place for A-line tracings
   - SW consult for med compliance
   - consider renal U/S to assess for artery stenosis
   .
   # Critical AS: Valve area 0.68 cm^2. Symptomatic with peak gradient of
   25 mm Hg. Has [**3-13**] symptoms for AS triad (angina, CHF).
   - f/u CSurg eval for AVR
   - avoid medications that could decrease preload, such as NTG
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF
   64% in [**4-/3015**]), with elevated PCWP. Critical symptomatic AS (0.7 cm^2)
   with peak to peak gradient of 25 mm Hg. Patient also with R sided PA
   and RA pressures on R heart cath, indicating evidence of pulmonary
   hypertension and right-sided heart failure, likely exacerbated in
   setting of L sided heart failure. Receive 40 mg IV lasix in cath lab
   with good urine output of -1 L. EF 64% in 3/[**3015**].
   - transition nitroprusside gtt to metoprolol and losartan today
   - no nitroglycerin given critical AS
   - f/u on BNP
   - f/u Csurg recs on AVR
   - f/u on CXR and TTE today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with history of SVT in 2/[**3014**]. Currently in sinus
   rhythm with prolonged PR and RBBB/left anterior fascicular block on
   EKG.
   - continue BB
   - telemetry
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: Patient with possible vascular dementia
   given hx of PVD and TIAs. A-line [**Location (un) 289**] higher than blood pressure
   cuff, consistent with a diagnosis of PVD.
   - continue ASA, Zetia
   .
   # Carotid artery disease: Patient with history of TIA in [**9-/3013**]
   (significant R sided ICA stenosis).
   - try to obtain carotid U/S records in AM
   - may need carotid U/S here at [**Hospital1 **] for pre-op eval
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Elevated LDL of 134, not at goal. HDL low at 11.
   Patient reportedly on Lipitor but discontinued due to patient concern
   about cirrhosis and possible liver damage.  Patient was put on zetia as
   a result.
   - continue Zetia 10 mg PO daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: BS 191 on admission. Patient without history of
   diabetes.
   - RISS with FS qACHS
   - f/u HgA1c
   .
   # Autoimmune Hepatitis with cirrhosis (Child's Class A). Followed by GI
   at [**Hospital1 **].
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25.  Admission hct 30.9. Ferritin checked at OSH
   was 73.
   - trend Hct
   .
   # History of seizure: Patient was admitted for seizure in [**7-17**].  She
   has been on Keppra, but self-discontinued it because of depression. No
   further episodes since then. Will continue to monitor.
