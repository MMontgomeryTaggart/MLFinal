   Assessment and Plan
   71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II,
   hypertension, is transfered from outside hospital s/p cardiac arrest
   s/p arctic sun protocol, since extubated, rewarmed
   # Respiratory status:
   MRSA sputum culture positive, being treated for pneumonia. CXR
   improved, bilateral effusions smaller than yesterday and rest of lungs
   clear.  Extubated succesfully two days ago with an episode of acute
   pulmonary edema afterwards requiring non-invasive positive pressure
   ventilation.  Stable on 3L O2 NC this AM.  Continues to have cough.
   - continue to wean oxygen as tolerated
   - day 5 antibiotics ; continue Vancomycin for [**7-3**] day course ; DCed
   ceftriaxone and flagyl
   - incentive spirometry
   - out of bed to chair
   - follow up cultures
   # s/p PEA arrest:
   PEA arrest of unknown etiology. 4 rounds of ACLS and transferred to
   [**Hospital1 1**].  The etiology may be secondary to unstable arrhythmia or
   infection. s/p Arctic Sun protocol.
   - monitor on tele
   - Cardiac Catheterization to evaluate for ischemic cause in setting of
   significant CAD history, likely Cath Monday
   - beta blocker as tolerated
   # Hypertension:
   Blood pressures stable, low normal.  At home she was on metoprolol,
   verapamil and lisinopril.
   - metoprolol tartrate 25mg TID
   - lisinopril
   # Sinus tachycardia:
   Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to beta blocker withdrawal. Does not
   appear fluid down. Does not appear septic anymore.  [**Month (only) 11**] be associated
   with anxiety or pain from right leg.
   - uptitrate metoprolol tartrate
   - minimize agitation
   - pain control
   # CAD: s/p STEMI with cardiac cath with multivessel CAD s/p BMS x 3 to
   mid to distal L circumflex in past. TTE shows EF 55% with some focal
   hypokinesis of inferolateral wall which is consistent with priors. CVP
   low to normal.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin, beta blocker
   - NPO p MN Sunday night for Cath on Monday
   # DMII:
   - HISS - adjust prn
   # Nutrition:
   - speech and swallow eval recommended ground solids and nectar
   prethickened liquids
