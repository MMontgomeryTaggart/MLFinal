TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  SOB
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 12645**] is an 81 year old F with a history of HOCM s/p ETOH
   ablation and ICD placement [**2839**], Atrial fibrillation (on Dronedarone),
   Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia who presented to ED with shortness of
   breath.
   .
   The patient states that on the day prior to admission, patient had what
   she thought to be an upper respiratory tract infection.  On the AM of
   [**12-12**], she woke up with significant shortness of breath that was present
   at rest and with exertion that prompted her to call EMS.  She was found
   to be significantly shortness of breath and was given Lasix 60mg IV x
   1.
   .
   In the ED, initial vitals were  T100.0, 124/67, 88, 24-26, 96% 2LNC.
   Patient was saturating comfortably on 2L NC after diuresis (unclear
   exactly how much) and was given Levaquin for cover for possible CAP.
   She became acutely SOB in the ED (for unclear reasons) and was given
   another bolus of Lasix 20mg IV x 1.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1859**]
   Cardiology Service.
   .
   On arrival to the floor, patient's shortness of breath improved.
   Shortly after transfer, the patient had a 20 beat run of polymorphic VT
   that resolved on its own.  She then developed another run of
   polymorphic VT lasting approximately 30 seconds at a rate of 220 BPM.
   ICD fired and coverted her rhythm to a WCT in 130s (approx 1 min) which
   appeared to be monomorphic VT on tele given episodes of AV
   dissociation.  This rhythm then spontaneously resolved.  She was
   transferred to CCU and given 4g IV Magnesium.
   .
   On tranfer, patient is HD stable.  Patient states that feels her SOB is
   improved.
   .
   On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. All of the other review of
   systems were negative unless included above in HPI.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain
   paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
   presyncope (in past several years).  Reports dyspnea on exertion and
   orthopnea this AM.

   CARDIAC CATH:  [**5-26**]
   1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrate no
   flow limiting lesions. The LMCa had no angiographically apparent
   disease. The LAD had no angiographically apparent disease. The Cx had
   no angiographically apparent disease. THe RCA had no angiographically
   apparent disease.
   2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided filling
   pressures with RVEDP of 18mmHg anf LVEDP of 26mmHg. There was moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with a PASP of 49mmHg. The
   cardiac index was preserved at 3.9 l/min/m2 .
   3. Measurement of the gradient within the left ventricle revealed no
   difference in systolic pressures (no outflow tract gradient).
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV
   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # # RHYTHM:  A sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx
   500.  Patient's polymorphic VT likely secondary to medications
   (doefetilide vs levaquin in ED) versus hypokalemia.  Patient received
   4g Mg.  Interrogation reveals appropriate function.  Unlikely to be
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries and no history of
   CAD.
   - Hold Doefetilide
   - Replete K > 4.5, Mg > 2.5
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - d/c levaquin
   - Cont BB, [**Last Name (un) **]

   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD.  Cath [**5-26**] reveals clean coronaries.
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  Evidence of
   volume overload on exam.  h/o moderate concentric LVH with preserved EF
   (> 70%).  Unclear etiology for patient's pulmonary edema (no evidence
   of ischemia, no dietary indiscretion).
