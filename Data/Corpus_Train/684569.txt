TITLE:
   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Doctor Last Name 13476**] on [**2560-2-17**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mild hypotension with decreased urine output necessitating initiation
   of neosynephrine  with increase in BP and UO.  Pericardial drain 100 cc
   /shift with increase upon initiation of heparin.  Will monitor output
   of drain with likely removal this PM.  Critical care time 30 minutes
   for management of hypotension, pressors and pericardial drainage
   catheter.
