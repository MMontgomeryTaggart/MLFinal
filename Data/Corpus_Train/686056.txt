Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - called out to floor yesterday; no beds yet, so wasn't transferred
   - Weaned off nitro
   - patient was chest pain free for most of day yesterday but described
   chest pain and SOB while walking with PT.
   -TEE demonstrated EF30%. Moderate to severe regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with mid to distal septal, anterior,
   antero-lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis. No masses or thrombi
   are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
   wall function. Trivial pericardial effusion. Trivial MR.

   Imaging: CATH:
   Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
   demonstrated single vessel disease. The LMCA, LCx and RCA had minimal
   disease. The LAD had a total occlusion mid-vessel.
   ECHO:
   EF 30%
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal septal, anterior,
   antero-lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis. No masses or thrombi
   are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
   wall function. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old male with HTN, HLD who was transferred from an outside
   hospital for STEMI after 4 days of constant chest pain, now s/p PCI
   with DES x2 in LAD.
   # CAD, s/p STEMI:
   s/p PCI w DESx2 to mid LAD and mid distal LAD. Patient had 4 days of
   constant chest pain with peak CK [**2810**] and Trop-I of 74. Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG shows persistent ST elevations in leads V2-V5 after
   intervention, may have aneurysm, risk of free wall rupture/VSD.
   Integrilin drip finished yesterday morning 10am.  Weaned off nitro
   yesterday.  Complained of chest pain w physical therapy yesterday.
   Persistent ST changes on EKG suggest aneurysm.
   - continue aspirin, prasugrel
   - cont low dose metoprolol
   - start high dose statin
   - morphine for pain control
   - started on heparin drip for prevention of LV thrombus
   - will need coumadin chronically for aneurysm
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Received small dye load (130cc) during Cardiac Cath two days ago.
   Urine electrolytes show FeNa 0.08%, but he does not appear dry on exam,
   though hyaline casts in UA also suggest intravascular volume depletion;
   FeNa could also suggest contrast-induced nephropathy.
   # Acute Fluid overload
   Likely secondary to stunned myocardium post MI and decreased EF 30%.
   Patient not on diuretics at home aside from Triamterene/HCTZ for BP
   control.  No complaints of acute shortness of breath, and will not
   diurese anyway in setting of possible contrast-induced nephropathy.
   - monitor for now
   # Hypertension
   - restart home triamterene/HCTZ
   - can uptitrate beta blocker as well as tolerated by BP
   # BPH
   - continue home flomax and cardura
