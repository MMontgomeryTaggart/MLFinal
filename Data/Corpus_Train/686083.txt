Chief Complaint:  shortness of breath, coughs
   HPI:
   85-year-old woman with history of asthma, COPD, afib on warfarin, HTN,
   sick sinus syndrome on pacemaker, recent possible septic knee joint in
   [**2925-12-7**] presented with a 4 days of shortness of breath and
   productive coughs with increased oxygen requirement at nursing home.
   She is not very mobile at baseline, needing to use a walker for
   ambulation. She also reported generalized fatigue, poor PO intake.
   Patient denied chest pain. CXR at nursing home was reportedly negative
   the day prior to admission, but patient was nevertheless started on
   levofloxacin. Patient also reported having had 2 loose stools per day
   for the past 2 days (baseline 1 regular stool per day), with no
   abdominal pain, no blood in the stools. Her stool on the day of
   admission was more formed.
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: T 96.4, HR 90, BP 144/86, RR 22, 100% on BiPAP.
   Lungs were wheezy. Her CXR was unremarkable. WBC was 14,000 (8,000 1
   week prior). Cardiac enzymes negative. ABG was 7.41/61/119. BNP was
   8461. She received ipratropium-albuterol nebs, furosemide 40 mg x 1
   with reportedly minimal urine output. Also got vancomycin and cefepime.
   BiPAP was eventually weaned off to 4L NC, sating 94%. Admitted to MICU
   for further management.
   .
   On arrival to MICU, patient was clinically stable, breathing

   silhouette appears unremarkable. Apart from mild chronic interstitial
   markings, the lungs are clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
   [**Hospital1 **]-apical scarring is unchanged. There is a pacer overlying the left
   axilla
   with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle in appropriate
   position.
   The osseous structures are unremarkable.
   IMPRESSION:
   No acute intrathoracic abnormality.
   Assessment and Plan
   85-year-old woman with history of asthma, COPD, afib on warfarin, HTN,
   sick sinus syndrome on pacemaker, recent possible septic knee joint in
   [**2925-12-7**] presented with a few days of shortness of breath with
   increased oxygen requirement, productive cough, generalized fatigue,
   poor PO intake at nursing home.
   # SOB: wheezing on exam. A possible pneumonia, discussed below, might
   trigger a COPD exacerbation. There is no evidence of CHF flare on exam
   or chest Xray.
   - standing and prn nebs
   - prednisone 40 mg qday
   - treat possible pneumonia as below
   - chest PT as needed
   - supplemental O2 as needed
   .
   # Possible pneumonia: productive coughs with dyspnea, with leukocytosis
   in the 14,000 with mild left shift. Concurrent loose stools
   - continue empiric rx with vanco and cefepime and levoflox (for
   possible Legionella); adjust once cx comes back
   - sputum cx
   - Legionella urinary Ag
   - blood cx
   - supplemental O2 as needed
   .
   # Afib with RVR: slightly tachycardic in the 100s--missed her beta
   blocker dose earlier today. Pulmonary process also likely contributes
   to RVR. Stable BP.
   - restart home regimen of metoprolol and flecaine
   - if persistently tachycardic, will give IV nodal [**Doctor Last Name **] boluses prn
   - hold warfarin given supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue metoprolol and lisinopril
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet
   # PPX: supratherapeutic INR; hence, holding heparin SQ
