Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 682**]
Chief Complaint:
[**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intensive Care, Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
57 y.o. male with history of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] who presented
to [**Hospital1 **] with complaints of fatigue, "low vision" and
nausea, and decreased function of his hands, b/l hip pain,
constipation x 1 week.

While being worked up was found to have a low-grade fever (per
wife- baseline temp is 94-95F) and UTI for which he received
Ceftriaxone and Vancomcyin and was also hyponatremic to 120.

He was given NS and shortly thereafter had two seizures and bit
his tongue during one of them with bleeding and was thus
intubated for airway protection in addition to receiving a total
of 3 mg IV Ativan.

He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurological evaluation. Of
note, patient does not have a history of seizure disorder and is
not on seizure medications. He has had one seizure in the past,
in the setting of an infection. After arriving to [**Hospital1 18**], he was
evaluated by neurology who felt that the patient's seizure was
likely multifactorial in etiology with infection and
[**Hospital1 **] being the likely contributors. Meningitis was on
the differential, though not felt to be very likely and given
his clinical instability, an LP was deferred and Ceftriaxone and
Vancomycin were continued. Head CT was also unremarkable. He was
then admitted to the MICU for further management.

ROS: No HA. No menigismus. Inc confusion, clumsiness, low vision
(typical of infection per wife). Erythema around suprapubic cath
site, but no exudate.


Past Medical History:
MS - since [**2488**], progressive, quadriplegic, neurogenic bladder
with suprapubic catheter, restrictive [**Year (4 digits) 1551**]'s
History of Aspiration PNAs
Esophageal Ulcer - [**1-31**] NSAIDs, [**2508**], small bowel bx negative
Recurrent UTIs
CHF (EF > 65% with moderate LVH in '[**08**])
HTN

Social History:
He is married 32 years and lives with his wife at home.  He has
three children and three grandchildren. He was a professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25581**] engineering at [**University/College 25582**], but
retired on disability after the [**2497**] spring semester due to his
MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is wheelchair-bound.  He denies tobacco, alcohol, and
recreational drug use.  Has personal care assistant.



Family History:

CV: distant sounds, RRR, accentuated split S2, no MRG
PULM: CTA B
Abd: obese, RLQ with baclofen pump, + BS, ND
Extrem: generalized edema with 1+ pitting LE edema bilaterally
to
above the knee. 1+ dp pulses bilaterally.

NEUROLOGIC EXAM:
MS- occasionally chewing on ET tube. pt does not open eyes to
voice. he does not follow commands. he does not localize noxious
stimuli.

CN- PERRL 5-->3 sluggish, corneal reflex intact bilaterally,
when
eyelids are opened he has conjugate roving eye movements, he
does
not regard the examiner, oculocephalic reflex intact, brisk gag
reflex.

Motor- withdraws left arm purposefully to nailbed pressure, no
withdrawal to pain on left, nail bed pressure on right foot
induces clonus but no withdrawal, left foot nailbed pressure
results in slight withdrawal.

left toe muted, right babinski reflex induces clonus.

Sensory- as above in motor exam. withdraws R arm, grimace on L
arm, RLE clonus, LLE grimace.

Reflexes- clonus at R ankle, absent patellar reflexes, 2+
symmetric brachioradialis, unable to elicit bicep or triceps
reflexes.


Pertinent Results:
EKG: Normal sinus at approximately 80, nl axis, nl PR, narrow
QRS, < 1 mm STD in II and TWI in III.

CT Head ([**4-14**]):
There is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of
normally midline structures, major vascular territorial infarct,
or intracranial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 347**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The osseous structures are
unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate
opacification of the ethmoid sinus.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.

CXR ([**4-14**]): Limited study due to low lung volumes. Endotracheal
tube
terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. Retrocardiac
opacity may represent the combination of atelectasis and pleural
effusion, cannot rule out consolidation. Followup is
recommended.

EEG
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there is an
interhemispheric
asymmetry with more complex rhythms, at times with faster
frequencies,
noted on the left compared with a slightly lower voltage and
slower
frequency activity over the right side.

ABNORMALITY #2: The background was of low voltage, disorganized,
and
slow typically in the [**6-6**] Hz frequency range, admixed with
bursts of
generalized mixed frequency theta and delta frequency slowing.

BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as this was a portable
study.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were noted.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 78 bpm.

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the
interhemispheric asymmetry with somewhat more complex and faster

frequency rhythms noted broadly over the left side compared with
lower
voltage and slower frequency rhythms noted over the right. The
findings
suggest bilateral subcortical dysfunction which is more
prominent over
the right side. In addition, the background was disorganized,
low
voltage and slow with admixed bursts of generalized mixed
frequency
slowing with this constellation of findings being consistent
with a
diffuse moderately severe encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic

disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of
encephalopathy but there are others. There were no epileptiform
features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2509-11-11**], the findings are similar.

VIDEO SWALLOW
OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION:

An oral and pharyngeal swallow evaluation was performed in
conjunction with speech and pathology department. Under
continuous videofluoroscopy, barium of various consistencies was
administered orally to the patient.

ORAL PHASE: Mastication of solids was slow. There was reduction
in AP tongue movement secondary to weakness. Bolus control was
mildly reduced with premature spillover into the pharynx. A mild
coating of the oral cavity residue remained after the swallow.
This was cleared with repeat swallows.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There was mild delay in swallowing initiation.
Epiglottic deflection was incomplete, although NG tube presence
may have been partially responsible. Pharyngeal transit time was
normal, but pharyngeal constriction appeared mildly reduced. A
mild coating of residue remained in the vallecula and piriform
sinuses after liquids and solids. This was cleared with repeat
swallows.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: There was penetration before the swallow
with thin liquids, nectar thick liquids and pureed solids. There
was one trace aspiration episode after the swallow. A
spontaneous throat clear was effective in clearing the aspirated
material.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia.
2. Premature spillover, swallow delay and reduced pharyngeal
constriction.
3. Penetration before the swallow, with one episode of trace
aspiration.

CXR [**2511-4-23**]
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Nasogastric tube is seen with tip
overlying the stomach, with residual contrast material within
the stomach. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable.
Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. Improved aeration
of the left base is noted. No definite consolidation identified,
although the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the image.

IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of the left base. No definite
focal consolidations are identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 y.o. male with MS who presented wtih UTI and
[**Year (4 digits) **] s/p seizures x 2.


SEIZURES
Patient does not have a history of a seizure disorder though he
has had one seizure in the past, in the setting of an infection.
He was found to have both UTI and pneumonia (possibly
aspiration) on admission. Additionally, he was hyponatremic to
120. Both of these factors likely contributed to the patient's
seizures. CT head was unremarkable. Neuro followed during his
admission.  He was loaded with dilantin and then transitioned to
Keppra.  No further seizures during admission. He should
continue to increase his keppra per schedule up to 1500mg PO
BID, up 500mg/day every 3 days.

WEAKNESS / MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
At baseline he is wheelchair bound and unable to life his legs.
He can raise both of his arms antigravity, and is typically able
to operate the remote control with his right hand.

The patient was followed by neurology. He has LE weakness at
baseline (in a wheelchair) and ha owrsening UE weakness that was
starting to improve on discharge. Admission exam as detailed
above.  It was not felt that he was having an MS flare; he
should follow up with his MS doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8651**], within [**12-31**]
weeks of discharge.

[**Month/Day (2) **]
Possible etiologies included hypovolemic hypoNa and SIADH. Given
that this was symptomatic [**Month/Day (2) **] and not clearly
hypovolemic in nature, slow infusion of hypertonic saline was
used to increase sodium by [**4-4**] mEq.  Urine osmoles initially
above 500.  The lowest urine osmolarity achieved was 390 despite
normal volume status, suggesting SIADH as a component.  Renal
saw the patient and agreed with SIADH, recommending a high salt
diet. The importance of fluid restriction was discussed
(previously drinking 3 liters per day free water). However, if
the patient needs to drink copious amounts for his suprapub
catheter (as recommended by urology), then he should have high
salt, high protein diet. With mild fluid restriction, sodium
improved into mid to upper 130s.


UTI / PROTEUS, YEAST
Patient has a history of recurrent UTIs s/p suprapubic catheter.
 UA appeared infected rather than colonized given the high
amount of WBCs. Cultures from OSH grew Klebsiella sensitive to
ceftriaxone and he completed a 7 day course.  Suprapubic
catheter was changed on [**4-17**].

He had low grade temperature to 100.1 and was pancultured. His
urine continued to grow yeast, and he was started on 5 days of
fluconazole on [**2511-4-23**].

BLOOD CULTURES were drawn sevaral points during this admission
and have all been negative in house.

ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA
Had infiltrate, fever, and clear aspiration after seizing with
tongue trauma.  He was treated with a 7 day course of
ceftriaxone/metronidazole.  Sputum cultures did not isolate
pathogens.  Support for respiratory failure as detailed below.

The patient was evaluated for recurrent aspiration risk. A
modified soft solid diet with thin liquids was recommended after
video swallow.


RESPIRATORY FAILURE
Patient reportedly has a history of restrictive lung disease,
which is evidenced on CXR, though by history, he was only
intubated for airway protection in the setting of a seizure. He
initially had higher than anticipated oxygenation requirements,
but this improved with treatment of his pneumonia.  He was
extubated [**4-16**].

[**Hospital1 **]/PAP was used on the medical floor at home settings [**12-9**].

THROMBOCYTOSIS
The patient developed elevated platelet counts while in house.
This was felt to be reactive process, possibly from yeast UTI.

CHF
Appears euvolemic to mildly fluid-up.  Some evidence of
pulmonary and peripheral edema.  Echo showed mod LVH with EF
70%.


DYSAUTONOMIA
The patient's wife reports that he runs low temperatures, and
was very concerned about temperatures which were 98-99, which
she considered fever. He was pancultured for these in the ICU
but cultures were all negative or no growth to date.

He had several swings in his blood pressure, for which iv
medication for hypertensive urgency (BP 200/100) were avoided.

HTN
Initially with borderline hypotension requiring decrease in
hypertension regimen.  Eventually HTN worsened - added back home
regimen (clonidine and beta blockade) plus hydralazine and
amlodipine.  He was transitioned to carvedilol from lopressor.
BP was overall quite labile and required frequent adjustment of
his regimen.
