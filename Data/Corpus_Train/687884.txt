   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   38M with NHL s/p alloBMT complicated by multi-organ GVHD and BO with
   severe baseline lung disease and CO2 retention, presenting with dyspnea
   and cough, now transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 42**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Baseline lung disease from
   bronchiolitis obliterans with CO2 retention, severe restrictive disease
   on PFTs and very low diffusion capacity.  Admitted with pneumonia and
   new left pleural effusion, now s/p full treatment with cefepime and
   levofloxacin with mild general improvement.  However, today with severe
   respiratory compromise and failure leading to intubation.  Events
   leading to decompensation unclear.  Differential includes worsening
   infection, aspiration, bronchospasm, primary CNS process (head bleed),
   PE, respiratory muscle weakness, infection/sepsis or other global
   decompensation (though hemodynamics initially okay).  PE a concerning
   possibilitiy given acuity of change and lack of DVT prophylaxis.  CNS
   process also a concern given some posturing and tremor following
   intubation (though more likely med related).
   Mucus plug
   No PE, flash pulm edema
   Infection
   Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure as detailed above
   Could potentially be fungal or atypical mycobacterium.
   - PECT now.  Will hold off on empiric treatment for now.
   - Head CT now.
   - Keep intubated on AC while undergoing workup.  ABG and Aline now.
   Goal pCO2 likely in 60-70 range (aim for very slightly acidemic pH
   given chronicity of respiratory acidosis).
   - Will continue treatment for HAP with cefepime, vanc, levofloxacin for
   now.
   - ?benefit from higher dose steroids if GVHD related.
   - Send sputum culture, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - Consider eval of left pleural effusion, though small and may be
   difficult.
   - Send viral panel.
   - Likely bronch now that intubated given desire to do as outpatient and
   lack of resolution of symptoms with current regimen for pneumonia
   (though vanc new today).
   .
   # Hypotension.  Normotensive prior to intubation but now with prolonged
   low BPs - ?positive pressure effect vs. sedation meds vs. worsening
   infection vs. obstructive process/PE vs. cardiogenic cause.
   - Repeat ECG (cannot find floor ECG here).
   - TTE.
   - CTA as above.
   - Check lactate.
   - Reculture.
   - Consider stress dose steroids (increase from current 30 mg pred).
   - Neosynephrine via PICC for now, consider change to norepi if
   continues.
   .
   # Tremor.  Occurring on BMT floor prior to events, though ?med effect
   from tacro.  Low suspicion for seizure activity given chronicity and
   with normal mental status prior.
   - Continue to monitor for now.
   - Holding tacro.
   .
   # Edema.  New this admission.  ?Effect of getting IVFs.  Past echos
   within normal limits.
   - Check TTE.
   .
   # Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo BMT: Most recent PET scan with no
   evidence of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.
   -Monitor counts and toxicities
   .
   # GVHD.
   - Respiratory plan as above.
   - Prednisone and MMF.
   - PPx with bactrim DS and Acyclovir (acyclovir had been changed to
   famvir in house due to ?elevation in bili, but cannot crush.
   .
   # Elevated LFTs.  At baseline from GVHD.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - Levothyroxine 125 mcg daily M-Saturday
   .
   # Gastric varices.  Asymptomatic.
   - Holding BB given hypotension.
   .
   # FEN: Will resume TPN, tube feed recs.
   # PPx: H2B, heparin SC.
