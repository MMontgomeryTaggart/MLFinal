   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient conversant, knew he was in [**Hospital 21**] Hospital in [**2924-12-18**]
   yesterday AM; mental status markedly improved from overnight and
   previous day.  His mental status slowly worsened as the day progressed
   -Around 2pm patient had large BM and had received 40mg torsemide two
   hours earlier, developed hypotension and appeared somnolent.  ECG
   demonstrated diffusely inverted T waves in anterior leads, remniscent
   of ECG on morning [**2924-12-12**] pre-PCI which also demonstrated T-wave
   inversions.  250cc bolus NS with resolution of pressures.
   - Decreased dose of metoprolol from 25 to 12.5mg TID and lisinopril
   from 5 to 2.5mg QD.  Changed dose of torsemide from 40mg QD to 20mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   in order to be able to hold med if diuretic involved in hypotensive
   episode.
   - overnight, he was given seroquel 12.5mg.  he was somnolent ~8pm, ABG
   done to eval for hypercarbia but pCO2 51; pt became agitated again
   overnight, angry but coherent

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with hx of CABG, DM, etoh abuse, transferred for cardiac
   catheterization s/p DES to LIMA-LAD, c/b intubation for hypoxemic
   respiratory failure and continued agitation.
   # Altered Mental Status/ Delirium:
   Alternating Hypoactive and Hyperactive Delirium.  The patient has been
   agitated since the outside hospital, likely delirious since
   presentation from outside hospital. He has multiple new lesions in his
   brain likely secondary to cath procedures with emboli. Has required
   restraints and chemical restraints to prevent injury to self and
   others. Continues w agitation particularly each night and has been
   somnolent in middle of day intermittently.  Has responded to seroquel
   for a couple of hours last night.  Geriatrics is following.  QTc
   yesterday ~450.  Also started on low dose neurontin last night as
   well.  UA negative.  No metabolic source found.
   - appreciate geriatrics recs
   - continue seroquel at night, and add prn Haldol TID, per Geriatrics
   recs
   - DCed neurontin
   - frequent reorientation
   - minimize lines and tubes as possible ; continues w foley catheter and
   telemetry and requires restraints intermittently, particularly at night
   - sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals as possible
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF:
   CHF with EF 30-35%. Appeared fluid overloaded and had hypoxemic
   respiratory failure requiring intubation previously; has had ABGs drawn
   multiple times in past several days for concern of somnolence and
   hypercarbia, but patient has been stable. Patient has been diuresed.
   Lasix DCed yesterday. 40mg torsemide appeared to drop blood pressures
   yesterday, so dose was decreased to 20mg [**Hospital1 7**].  Urine output and mental
   status may correlate with blood pressure.
   - continue 20mg torsemide but decrease to DAILY in order to help
   maintain BP
   - oxygen for SaO2 > 92%
   - Continue Metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg TID (decreased doses from
   yesterday after hypotensive episode)
   - DCed lisinopril to improve blood pressure
   #. NSTEMI/CAD:
   Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are concerning for unstable
   angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of  NSTEMI in the setting of
   Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are available from the OSH. Serum
   troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 17**] was 0.04. Cardiac catheterization
   demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 & LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient
   agitation during procedure prevented completion of cardiac
   catheterization. s/p DES to SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD. Chest pain free. CE
   stable.
   - cont aspirin 325mg
   - cont plavix
   - cont atorvastatin 80mg
   - metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - holding low dose acei
   - telemetry
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - Continue NPH 22u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale and adjust prn
   #. EtOH abuse: Outside window for withdrawal. Monitor.
   - SW consult
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 2.5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   #. Anxiety/Depression: Stable.
   - Continue to observe
