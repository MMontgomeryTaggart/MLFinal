   Assessment and Plan
   83 F with HTN s/p recent [**Last Name (un) **] with right hip fracture admitted to MICU
   in setting of hypotension likely secondary to volume depletion and
   medications
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely related to decrease PO intake in the setting
   of continue anti hypertensive therapy. No signs of infection. ECHO
   without concern for saddle embolus.  Cardiac Enzymes flat
   - f/u blood, urine cx
   - f/u TTE final read
   - Discontinue vanco/levo emprically for 48 hrs given unclear etiology
   of hypotension
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Right Acetabular hip fracture- non operative per orthopedics
   - Fu portable AP pelvis per ortho recs
   - Breakthrough pain control with IV morphine
   - Standing Acetaminophen
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney injury: Resolved with fluid repletion. Urine
   lytes consitent with pre renal etiology.
   - IVF hydration and follow CVP and UOP
   - place foley catheter
   .
   # Anemia: HCT down overnight. All cell lines down, most likely partly
   dilutional. Given recent pelvis fracture small concern for bleed into
   pelvis. Family reports patient has not been taking EPO recently.
   - [**1-23**] CKD, monitor given no evidence of bleeding
   .
   # Hypertension- currently hypotension, hold home meds
   .
   # GERD- continue outpatient lansoprazole
   .
   # FEN: NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: R IJ
