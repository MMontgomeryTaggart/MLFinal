Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1834**]
Chief Complaint:
Wheezing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 yo man with history of GERD s/p fundoplication,
HTN, Charcot-[**Doctor Last Name **]-Tooth disease who presents to the Emergency
Department with worsening shortness of breath. Patient states
that for the past 2-3 weeks he has had worsening shortness of
breath. Patient describes this as wheezing which can last
'through the night'. These episodes can occur when walking to
the bathroom or at rest. He has never had wheezing before. He
denies any recent, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
radiating pain, peripheral edema, PND, orthopnea. He does sleep
with 2+ pillows but he does this for his GERD. He also denies
any recent abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, urinary frequency.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.1, HR 53, BP 165/93, RR 24.
Patient was given ASA 325 mg, NS IVF at 100cc/hr. Patient had an
acute episode of hypoxia requirng BIPAP. He was given Solumedrol
125 mg IV, Levaquin 750 mg, Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV.  ECG done which
showed ? q waves in V1,V2. Cardiac biomarkers were drawn and
Troponin-T was elevated at 0.34 with normal CK of 62. Heparin
gtt was started for concern of acute coronary syndrome. Patient
sent for CTA, which was negative for pulmonary embolus, but
showed ? bibasilar consolidations consistent with aspiration vs
atelectasis. Patient then went into atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response and was given diltiazem 10 mg IV x 1
then started on a diltiazem gtt. He ws also given Lopressor 5 mg
IV without resolution of tachycardia. Lasix 10 mg IV also given
in ED. Patient required BIPAP for 1 hour in ED and was then
placed on face tent O2.

Micro
Blood cultures x 4, urine cx, sputum cx no growth

EKG: Irregular rate and rhythm, T wave flattening I-III. T wave
inversions V1-V5.  qwaves V1-V2.

CXR [**2625-3-10**]
Study is limited by lordotic positioning. Heart size is within
normal limits given technique. The mediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Lungs are
clear. No effusion or pneumothorax detected however the extreme
left costophrenic angle not included on this radiograph.
Numerous surgical clips are present within the upper abdomen
from nissen procedure.

CTA Chest [**2625-3-10**]
  No thoracic aortic dissection is identified. No filling
defects within the pulmonary arteries to suggest acute pulmonary
embolism. There are no pathologically enlarged axillary,
mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes per CT size criteria. A small
pericardial effusion is present. Moderate coronary artery
calcifications.
  Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates bibasilar consolidations,
right greater than left with impacted endobronchial secretions
and peribronchial thickening. A trace left pleural effusion is
noted.
  Evaluation of the upper abdomen is limited; however, evidence
of a laparoscopic Nissen with multiple surgical clips noted.
There is herniation of the proximal portion of the laparoscopic
Nissen consistent with a small hernia.
  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified. At the
T11/T12 vertebral bodies, there is severe intervertebral body
disc space narrowing and vacuum phenomenon. Significant
sclerosis of these vertebral bodies present with erosion at the
endplates.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2625-3-20**]
  There is a trace pericardial effusion vs. pericardial
thickening that is unchanged from the recent CTA of the chest of
[**3-10**]. There remains evidence of bibasilar aspiration, with
patchy bibasilar opacities, flecks of barium in the medial right
lower lobe, and bronchial wall thickening. Opacities have
actually improved since [**3-10**]. The small herniation of the
laparoscopic Nissen at the thorax is unchanged from [**3-10**]
as well.
  Images in the abdomen and pelvis are degraded by streak
artifact due to high-density material in the colon, and due to
multiple clips near the gastroesophageal junction. The
non-contrast appearance of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. The spleen is mildly enlarged,
measuring about 14.1 cm in diameter.
  Kidney and urologic evaluation is quite limited for technical
reasons already described. There is no hydronephrosis. No
calculi are seen in the kidneys.
  No mass lesions are detected, though the evaluation is
incomplete without IV contrast. The stomach is moderately
distended. Small bowel loops are unremarkable. Barium is
retained throughout the colon. No free air or free fluid in the
abdomen is visualized. Air is seen in the left anterior
abdominal wall subcutaneous tissues, possibly related to
injection. Hyperdense material is seen in the musculature of the
left paramedian anterior abdominal wall, possibly representing
calcified suture. Inside the left anterior abdomen there is a
tubular dense structure just anterior to the stomach oriented in
a craniocaudal direction, which may represent a calcified
vessel.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Detail is markedly
obscured due to streak artifact from bowel contrast. There is a
Foley catheter within the bladder, and air within the bladder
likely related to instrumentation. There are calcifications in
the prostate, mild. The rectum is filled with stool and is
otherwise unremarkable. No free fluid in the pelvis, and no
pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: There are advanced degenerative changes of the
lumbar spine. The patient is post-bilateral L4-5 and partial S1
laminectomies. There is intervertebral disc space narrowing at
all levels, multiple Schmorl's nodes, large anterior
osteophytes, and degenerative endplate changes.

Barium esophagram [**2625-3-14**]
Evaluation of chest radiographs performed one day prior shows
multiple surgical clips projecting over the epigastric and left
upper abdominal regions. The patient was positioned upright at
approximately 80 degrees, in the left posterior oblique
position. During the initial swallow of thick barium, oral
contrast was seen not only descending the esophagus, but also
the trachea, predominantly into a right lower lobe bronchus,
with a trace amount also seen within the left bronchus. Views of
the esophagus show no gross abnormality. However, the study was
very limited as no further contrast was administered.

Video Swallow [**2625-3-15**]
Oral bolus formation, AP tongue movement, and oral transit times
were within functional limits. Bolus control was mildly reduced
with intermittent premature spillover with thin and nectar thick
liquids. No significant oral cavity residue remained after the
swallow. During the pharyngeal phase, there was mild delay in
swallow initiation with liquids. Once started, palatal
elevation, laryngeal elevation, and epiglottic deflection were
complete. Laryngeal valve closure was mildly reduced. Pharyngeal
transit was timely with mild reduced bolus propulsion. Mild
amount of residue remained within the valleculae and piriform
sinuses after swallowing all consistencies. However, the patient
cleared the residue with spontaneous repeat swallows. Esophageal
sphincter opening was mildly reduced at the height of the
swallow. The patient was seen to aspirate before, during and
after the swallow once during administration of thin liquids
using a straw due to premature spillover and swallow delay.
Aspiration was silent and cued coughs were ineffective at
clearing the aspirate.
IMPRESSIONS: Mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia, with
aspiration seen before, during, and after the swallow due to
premature spillover, swallow delay, and residue in the piriform
sinuses. While aspiration with thick liquids was not reproduced
today, the patient aspirated on thin liquids. Both episodes
occurred during consecutive sips of liquid.
  For further treatment techniques and dietary recommendations,
please refer to speech and swallow pathology note on CareWeb.

Echo [**2625-3-11**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the anterior
septum and anterior wall and distal inferior wall. There is an
apical left ventricular aneurysm. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 30-35 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with apical
aneurysm and extensive regional dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD
distribution). Moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Dilated ascending aorta.

P-MIBI [**2625-3-16**]:
Left ventricular cavity size is mildly enlarged, and does not
enlarge further with stress. Rest and stress perfusion images
reveal a moderate-severity fixed mid/distal anterior and
anteroseptal wall defect and a severe fixed apical defect. Gated
images reveal akinesis of the apex with mild global hypokinesis.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 35%.

PFTs [**2625-3-24**]
FEV1 2.13, FVC 3.53, FEV/FVC 60% MMF 0.95
TLC 4.83 FRC 2.84 RV 2.07
Although the reduced TLC is consistent with a mild restrictive
ventilatory defect, TLC may be underestimated due to a
suboptimal SVC maneuver. There is a mild to moderate gas
exchange defect. There are no prior studies available for
comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo man with history of GERD s/p fundoplication, Hypertension,
Charcot [**Doctor Last Name **] Tooth disease with acute on chronic aspiration
pneumonitis/pneumonia, now with acute on chronic systolic heart
failure, elevated troponin consistent with NSTEMI.

# Acute on chronic aspiration pneumonia/Respiratory Distress:
Improved after initial MICU stay. Patient has signs of acute on
chronic aspiration on CT chest, with concern for pneumonia given
consolidation on CT scan. Aspiration is likely secondary to
known GERD. He also has evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR with
a BNP of >16,000 so CHF also a contributer. Tracheomalacia is
being worked up as an outpatient. Patient had required
intermittent BIPAP initially but he remained off BiPAP after
24-48 hours. He was treated with 7 day course of Levofloxacin.
Oxygen saturations remained mid 90s prior to discharge off
supplemental oxygen. He had no further complaints of shortness
of breath. He was initially diuresed with Lasix 20-40mg PO daily
but this was discontinued since patient appeared euvolemic with
borderline low BPs as discussed below. He had PFTs prior to
discharge since was started on Amiodarone. He should maintain
aspiration precautions with PO intake as instructed in dietary
discharge instructions.

# NSTEMI:  Patient had NSTEMI on admission with T wave
flattening I-III, T wave inversions V1-V5. He was treated with
aspirin as well as heparin gtt for NSTEMI and atrial
fibrillation. NSTEMI likely secondary to demand ischemia in
setting of tachycardia. Anticoagulation was then transitioned to
Coumadin with lovenox bridge. He was also started on statin. He
was initially on beta blocker but this was held seocndary to
bradycardia with HR 50s as well as initial concern for
bronchospasm. Given his comorbidities, he was not felt to be a
good candidate for CABG (as multivessel CAD was likely given his
LV systolic heart failure). A conservative risk stratification
strategy was undertaken, and a pharmacological stress test
showed moderate fixed mid/distal anterior and anteroseptal
defect, and severe fixed apical defect. As no objective evidence
of residual post-infarct ischemia was found, revascularization
was not pursued, and his CAD was treated medically.

# Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Patient with no prior history of
atrial fibrillation. It was thought that initial episode was
secondary to aspiration pneumonia, but he had recurrent episode
in hospital and was transferred back to CCU where he was started
on amiodarone. Per their report, he was not interested in an
ablative procedure. He remained in sinus rhythm after being
started on amio with no further episodes of SVT. He was
initially maintained on metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] but this was
discontinued secondary to bradycardia. Regarding Coumadin
dosing, he was started on Coumadin 2 mg daily. This was changed
to 1 mg daily on [**2625-3-20**] since INR rapidly became therapeutic
and can interact with amiodarone. On [**2625-3-24**], INR 3.9 so
Coumadin held. He should have close daily monitoring of INR to
determine when to restart Coumadin (at 0.5-1mg daily). Goal INR
[**3-8**] for atrial fibrillation as well as LV aneurysm on echo. He
will complete [**Hospital1 **] dosing of amiodarone x 7 days (4 more days)
after [**3-24**] then should continue daily dosing.

# Acute systolic heart failure: Patient with acute LV systolic
heart failure (LVEF 30-35%) with no previous data in our system.
We attempted to optimize a heart failure regimen with low dose
lisinopril, beta blocker, and Lasix. However, he had poor PO
intake in house with hypotension with SBP 90s which dropped to
80s when we tried to reinitiate these meds. He was also
bradycardic HR 50s-60s. Would recommend adding back captopril
6.25 mg TID as BP tolerates. If he tolerates ACE-I, would then
consider adding Imdur. Will also need daily assessment of volume
status and oxygen saturations to determine if needs diuresis.

# GERD: Continued on PPI. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 672**] following. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 672**] would
like to perform endoscopy after cardiac issues have resolved.

# Hematuria: Patient developed hematuria on admission with
presumed Foley trauma in the setting of anticoagulation. Urine
cytology was negative. CT urogram was performed but was
nondiagnostic. He was continued on continuous bladder irrigation
which was titrated to light pink urine then clamped on [**2625-3-23**].
He had voiding trial on [**2625-3-24**] which he passed. He will follow
up with urology.

Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, voiding without difficulty,
hematuria resolved

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and a fast and
irregular heart rate. This caused increased demand on your heart
and you had a small heart attack. Your pneumonia was treated
with antibiotics. Your irregular rhythm was treated with a
medication called amiodarone. We also started you on a blood
thinning medication called coumadin to prevent strokes which can
happen with irregular heart rhythyms. You will need to have
blood levels monitored very closely while you are on coumadin.
We tried treating you with medications for your heart disease
but were limited by your slow heart rate and low blood pressure.
While you were in the hospital, you also had blood in your
urine, most likely from being on blood thinning medications. You
had a foley catheter which was irrigating your bladder which was
discontinued on [**2625-3-24**] and you voided without difficulty prior
to discharge.

We made the following changes to your home medications
1. We icnreased your aspirin to 325 mg daily
2. We increased your omeprazole to twice daily dosing
3. We added captopril which should be slowly added to your
medications regimen as your blood pressure tolerates. If your
blood pressure tolerates, you should take 6.25 mg three times
daily. If your systolic blood pressure is still >95, you should
also add Imdur or a beta blocker as determined by your
outpatient physician.
4. We added Coumadin. You were initially on 2mg daily, then 1 mg
daily. We held your coumadin on [**2625-3-24**] and you will need to
have your INR checked to determine when to restart it. Goal INR
[**3-8**].
