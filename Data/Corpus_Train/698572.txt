CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING
   67 year-old man with complex recent and past history now presents with
   hematemesis, hemtaochezia, and lightheadedness.  In the ED, hypotense
   to high 80s; Hct 22.  Received fluid and 2 units PRBCs, 2 units FFP,
   and 1 unit platelets.  NGL with dark blood.  Received PPI.  Had dynamic
   EKG changes with slight anterior ST depressions.  Abdominal CT done
   (prelim negative for signs concerning for leak), vascular surgery and
   GI consults.
   Taken urgently for EGD with GETA due to instability.  Single-attempt
   intubation.  EGD showed duodenal ulcer
 clipped.
   PMH especially notable for
   CAD s/p PCI.  ?other arterial stenting
   AAA and bilateral common iliac aneurysms planned for intervention and
   s/p coiling
   [**Last Name (un) 446**]
s gangrene (SP catheter)
   Diabetes
   ?chronic kidney disease
   Home meds reviewed (see resident note).  Planned to end levoflox [**12-30**].
   FH, SH, ROS, Allergies as per resident note.  Patient is currently
   drowsy, recovering from anesthesia.
   Exam
   99.8   97   114/62   15    97%
   Comfortable, follows commands
   Regular heart
   Clear lungs (somewhat obscured by upper airway sounds
   Soft abdomen
   ~2 cm granulating perineal incision
   SP tube
   3 PIVs (2 x 18, 1 x 16g)
   Labs, medications, and imaging all reviewed.
   Assessment and Plan
   67-year-old man with massive upper GI bleed, apparently due to bleeding
   duodenal ulcers.  Although aorto-enteric fistula is on DDx, current
   imaging, endoscopy, and vascular surgery assessment argues against
   this.  We will plan
   GI bleed
   - PPI gtt
   - maintain adequate IV access (presently adequate), units in blood
   bank, etc.
   - transfuse as needed with Hct goal of 28-30
   - GI, surgery, and vascular surgery all aware
   Myocardial ischemia
   Dynamic ST changes consistent with ischemia, very likely represented
   demand from anemia rather than unstable plaque.  Main therapy is
   therefore control of GI bleed and transfusion.
   Acidosis
   Appears to have an entirely non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely related
   to hyperchloremia from saline.  Respiratory compensation is somewhat
   less than expected
 repeat ABG later tonight.
   Kidney disease (?chronicity)
   Follow for now.  Received IV contrast.  Will keep Hct up, and give
   bicarb for potential renal protection (though may be ineffective at
   this point)
   Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4803**]
s note.
   He is critically ill: 40 minutes
