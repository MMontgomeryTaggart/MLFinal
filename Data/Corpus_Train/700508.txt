Chief Complaint:
   Leg pain and altered mental status.
   24 Hour Events:
   Just one 22 g PIV at present and poor access and unable to get coags
   this a.m.

   One non-sustained run of tachycardia. Different morphology to sinus
   QRS, but not wide enough for ventricular. Likely alternate pacemaker or
   tract.
   Pain somewhat localized to hip. X-ray of the hip shows erosion of the
   acetabulum and subchonral sclerosis worse on the right

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with PVD s/p LLE endarterectomy stenting; bilateral DVT on coumadin
   and s/p IVC filter placement; admitted with RLE pain and found to have
   nonocclusive bilateral DVT.  Transferred to MICU for further management
   of access issues, coagulopathy, and anemia in setting of DVT.
   # Coagulopathy
   INR of 8.1 with relative hematocrit drop. INR of 8.1 likely related to
   her chronic diarrhea plus coumadin.  No recent antibiotics known.
   Verbal report of being guaiac negative in ED.  Some ?of hematuria and
   hemoptysis as per HPI.
   - Guaiac stools.
   - Correct INR for line placement with 3 units FFP.
   - Consider transfusion if Hct < 21 or evidence of bleeding.
   - No evidence of respiratory compromise currently but closely monitor
   with recheck of CXR in AM given ?hemoptysis.
   - Check UA.
   - Consider vitamin K 10 mg, but latency not immediately helpful.
   # Afib/bradycardia/ Rhythm
   Likely bypass tract with possible reentry given rate. Electrolytes WNLs
   this a.m.
 e.g. no hypocalcemia.Afib relatively recent diagnosis.
   Anticoagulated already and on nodal agents. Typically has therefore had
   asymptomatic slow ventricular response with some alarms for < 40 bpm on
   floor. She may need PPM given slow rates. Now with rapid possible
   atrial tachycardia. Seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 274**] already on [**12-16**].
   - If consistent with goals of care, ensure Cardiology/EP following
   given new event and already consideration of PPM (may need ICD)
   - Will monitor on tele for now.
   # Bilateral DVT
   Nonocclusive in all veins.  Last LENIs from [**10/2611**] also with bilateral
   nonocclusive thrombi, but involving less of the veins that current
   study seems to suggest.  She has been therapeutic on coumadin; unclear
   why progression of clot despite coumadin therapy (even supratherapeutic
   currently).  Possibly due to inter-rater variability. Will need to d/w
   ultrasound. Patient with IVC filter in place as well.
   - Review comparisons with radiology.
   - Given access issues, will cautiously give FFP for planned line
   placement.
   - Daily INRs and will likely start lovenox vs. heparin gtt once INR <
   [**1-8**].  Hold off on coumadin for now given need for line and anemia.
   - Heme consult for hypercoaguable workup and guidance on management of
   refractory clot; highly suspicious of malignancy.
   - ?Change of coumadin to lovenox as ?represents coumadin failure.
   - Needs review of malignancy workup (particularly needs colonoscopy
   given GI issues).
   # Leg pain
   Concern that this was related to DVT, but patient with PVD and can
   certainly have other causes for acute onset leg pain.  Pulses
   dopplerable (no sign of acute arterial occlusion).  No evidence or
   reason for compartment syndrome.  Also has ?popliteal cyst, though no
   clear evidence of effusion (overlying edema makes it difficult to
   tell).  Pain well controlled with APAP. Pain somewhat localized to hip.
   X-ray of the hip shows erosion of the acetabulum and subchonral
   sclerosis worse on the right
 fitting with pain. CK normal. Likely
   osteoarthritis of the right hip is contributing, although DVT needs
   further investigation.
   - D/w ultrasound LENI results as above.
   - Management of DVT as above.
   - APAP prn.
   # Anemia
   Was originally to come in for scope. Baseline anemia with now 4 point
   Hct drop.  Coagulopathic as well.  No evidence of major active bleeding
   anywhere.  B12 and folate recently normal; recent TSH normal.  Has not
   had Fe studies in >1 year.  No past colonoscopies. Crit came back later
   this a.m. at 21.
   - Add on Fe studies.
   - D/w GI about need for scope (may be based on desired level of
   aggression and d/w family about goals
 also see below for issues
   surrounding diarrhea)
   - Guaiac stools
   - f/u Haptoglobin.
   - Transfuse < 21 or evidence of active bleeding.
   - Given now 21, will given 1 unit PRBCs
   # Abnormal CXR.
   R lower lung field with opacity greater than left base with some
   collapse on right that is now resolving. Improved slightly overnight
   with diuresis although not prominent cephalization. Concern for
   consolidation, although appears somewhat diffuse. Possible pneumonia.
   Legionella negative. Has significant hospital and health care exposure
   recently.  Also with dysphagia and some concern that she could be
   aspirating. No fever, leukocytosis, or reported cough per patient and
   daughter, though do provide history of ?hemoptysis. No WBC. Will hold
   on treatment for now.
   - Antibiotic cover : planned meropenem last night. Considered adding
   vancomycin but suspicion for PNA now lower.
   - F/u sputum culture
   - Repeat TTE to look at RV function given appearance of film.
   # UTI
   Based on UA.
   - Follow culture
   - Meropenem (penicillin allergy)
   # Diastolic heart failure
   Appears mildy volume overloaded with elevated JVD and LE edema.
   However, no clear evidence of pulmonary edema.  Patient unclear re:
   weight changes or progression of edema. Need to repeat echo to
   determine reliability of physical signs (tricuspid disease, pulmonary
   hypertension, change in systolic function. BNP elevated from probable
   baseline but lower than [**Month (only) 1924**] presentation ([**2601**] and [**Numeric Identifier 10209**]
   respectively)
   - Hold lasix and lisinopril for now given renal failure.
   - Check BNP to compare to priors
   - Strict Is/Os, daily weights
   - Repeat TTE mainly to eval for change in R sided pressures as with
   significant peripheral edema, valvular dysfunction.
   # ARF
   Creatinine 1.3 -> 1.2 this a.m. Mildly elevated compared to recent
   baseline. Overall volume overloaded, but may have poor left sided
   forward flow. Likely pre-renal whether due to decreased perfusion or
   desiccation. FE urea will be decision point for further investigations.
   - Hold lasix and ACEI for now pending determination of nature of ARF
   - Urine lytes added on to UA
 need to f/u but likely pre-renal
   - Consider renal ultrasound and further w/u depending on above.
   # Diarrhea
   One month history.  Unclear etiology, C diff seems unlikely given
   multiple negative studies, though does have past history of this.  Was
   supposed to go for inpatient colonoscopy. No medications that would
   cause this.
   - Will d/w GI given that now admitted - ?further stool studies or
   colonoscopy this admission.
   # Transaminitis
   Mild elevations today for unclear reasons. Cardiogenic versus biliary
   tract (more likely given AP).
   - Add on GGT and direct bilirubin
   - Recheck in AM.
   - RUQ US depending on further LFTs.
   # Lethargy
   Resolving. Likely a product of poor sleep due to pain/illness +/- acute
   infection, etc. Head CT negative for bleed. B12 and TSH normal within
   last month. Head CT negative.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, aspiration diet
   # Prophylaxis: supratherapeutic on coumadin
   # Access: peripheral 22 g only, will place EJ today most likely, before
   heading to the floor. PICC line possible but INR very high, therefore
   go for EJ instead for now.
