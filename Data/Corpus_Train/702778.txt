   Assessment and Plan
   70M with Type 2 DM, HTN, CHF, AF, s/p pericardial drain for idiopathic
   effusion, admitted to MICU with PNA, large bilateral pleural effusions,
   possible CVA, resp distress with incrased somulence requiring
   intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: Had been doing well on CPAP/PSV from 0800
   AM [**2-4**] to 0200 [**2-5**], but with downward tending minute volume. At 0200
   put back on vent for ABG 7.22/85/117 and has remained on Assist Control
   since. CXR: RLL haziness compared to [**2-4**]; derecruited? But CXR from
   this morning looks impoved. No PTX on the right side where effusion was
   diagnostically tapped (only 50cc removed). WBC bumped yesterday but
   back to baseline again today (~8.3)
   - Discontinue Zosyn that was restarted yesterday for ?reblossoming
   pneumonia
   - Follow-up sputum culture; gram stain negative
   - Follow-up rheum labs
 [**Doctor First Name **] positive, titer still pending this morning
   - Will diurese today and trial SBT. If unsuccessful, will do
   thoracentesis therapeutically this afternoon and then attempt
   extubation
   - If cultures remain negative, may consider steroids since pericardial
   and parapneumonic effusions consistent with exudative process (could be
   collagen vascular disease vs. lung infection vs. malignancy vs. PE)
   .
   # Expressive aphasia/AMS- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA per
   neuro. MRI/MRA negative for acute processes so ?delirium/toxic
   metabolic in addition to cardioembolic stroke as etiology. Back on
   Heparin gtt but with low PTT goal for possible thoracentesis later
   today
   - BP control
   #. AF / Bradycardia- Looks like tachy-brady syndrome. After D/c
   standing Dilt per cards recs, patient had frequent PVCs and bradys to
   40s and 30s, but no more episodes in the last 24 hours. (Prior bradys
   had been seen as possibly vagal w/ETT).
   - Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt per above
 eventual bridge
   to coumadin will be needed
   - EP f/u once stable for ablation &pacer
   - Atropine and pacer pads at bedside
   # Hypernatremia-. Received D5W at 100/hr X1L after D5W with bicarb and
   500cc of D5W in KCl repletion, Na+ went from 149->146
 147
   - Patient receiving free water with flushes for PEG tube feeds
   - PM lytes for resumption of Lasix diuresis
   .
   #. Dysphagia- Likely secondary to cardioembolic CVA. Failed a swallow
   study; PEG placed yesterday and can be used starting this afternoon
   - Continuing heparin gtt for now
   # Pericardial effusion: Unclear etiology, cultures were negative.
   - Monitor clinically for reaccumulation
   - Cardiology: no further recs
   .
   # DM2- On metformin at home.
   - ISS, follow fingersticks
   .
   # HTN- Continue amlodipine
   # BPH/hematuria- Hematuria improving
   - Will need outpatient cystoscopy
   - Continue foley for now since intubated
   - Resume flomax prior to foley removal
   # FEN: PEG tube feeds, replete electrolytes PRN
