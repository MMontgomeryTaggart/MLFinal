   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 304**] y/o M with history of CHF, ?COPD who was sent to the ED from [**Hospital 11**]
   Rehab for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress
 dCHF vs. PNA vs. COPD.  Story does not seem
   likely for COPD. Pt is now s/p intubation. Likely a component of
   CHF/fluid overload. For this, the patient has received Lasix boluses.
   Also, possibly a component of PNA, as pt was noted to have purulent
   sputum from ET tube.
   - continue bolus lasix to attempt to get fluid off of pt
 goal for
   today of negative 500 to 1000 cc
   - trend ABG's
   - vanc/cefepime for empiric therapy for PNA
   - resuming bronchodilators
   - continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - repeat echo in AM
   - sputum cx sent, will f/u
   - attempt to wean down pressors
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with a history of CAD, no other details seen in OMR.
   - attempt to obtain outside records
   - conitnue ROMI
   .
   # PUMP: Reported history of CHF, although most recent echo in OMR does
   not show notable systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
   - repeat echo in AM
   - continue to bolus lasix for fluid removal
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt is in a demand-paced rhythm.
   - continue telemetry
   - continue coumadin for atrial fibrillation
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt with a history of atrial fibrillation. He is
   on coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - continue coumadin with goal INR [**12-26**]
   - FFP on standby in case pt needs a CVL
   .
   # Hypertension - Pt with a history of hypertension but is not on any
   antihypertensives.
   - attempt to obtain outside records
   - monitor BP, currently borderline hypotensive
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   # ?COPD - Pt with reported history of COPD.
   - attempt to obtain outside records
   - restarting bronchodilators
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency - Baseline Cr is 1.3 - 1.6.
   Current Cr is 1.9.  Likely, this is pre-renal in the setting of CHF
   (?poor forward flow).
   - continue to trend creatinine
