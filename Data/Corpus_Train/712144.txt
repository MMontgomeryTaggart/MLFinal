   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - No more CP
   - Again with hypoglycemia to 38 after big reductions in insulin,
   corrected briskly, will need to reduce insulin again today. Probably
   secondary to poor PO intake
   - Pt tearful when discussing repeated hospitalizations; e-mailed her
   PCP and cardiologist about whether palliative care discussion
   appropriate
   - restarted amlodipine and put lisinopril and valsartan on allergy list
   b/c of hyperkalemia

   Assessment and Plan
   Elderly patient presenting again, as previously, with acute on chronic
   renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia.
   .
   # Diabetes/hypoglycemia: pt continues to have episodes of hypoglycemia
   despite decreasing doses of NPH.  [**Month (only) 11**] be from poor renal clearance of
   insulin.  Risks of insulin outweigh benefits at this point given her
   recurrent hypoglycemic events
   - D/C NPH for now
   - plan to contact [**Name (NI) 291**] for long term plan regarding insulin
   - continue scaled down sliding scale with humalog
   .
   # Renal Failure
   Improving.  The patient originally presented fluid overloaded, and
   creatinine rose from 2.0 on [**5-1**] to 3.7 on admission.  Lisinopril may
   have been given in excess by accident at [**Hospital3 57**] center. One
   notable new medication is also Bactrim. Renal faiure led to
   hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia, uremia. Uremia likely
   explains symptoms and hyperkalemia causing EKG changes.
   - Hold lisinopril for now
   - Hold hydralazine but will consider restarting
   - Diurese gently per above
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - Follow BUN/Cr closely while diuresing
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   Classic EKG findings of hyperkalemia, with probable junctional rhythm -
   P waves difficult to appreciate on EKG. AF with small atrial potentials
   and junctional rhythm are also possible. We treated underlying
   hyperkalemia. Still with occasional moments of bradycardia and
   occasional dropped beat.
   - Continue to follow potassium
   - Since recently started amlodipine for hypertension will hold on
   restarting coreg today, but will consider in future
   - Hold hydralazine (if becomes hypotensive, will not be able to
   accomodate with rate).
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   NSTEMI via demand per above.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, heparin gtt
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Chest pain: Resolved. Was likely GI related or anxiety as improved
   with GI cocktail and ativan.
   - stop hep gtt
   .
   # Troponin leak: Probably was demand ischemia in the setting of acute
   on chronic heart failure given lateral ST depressions. Third set of
   enzymes were positive confirming NSTEMI via demand etiology.
   - Stop hep gtt
   - continue to trend trop until peak
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolving. Secondary to renal failure.
   - Monitor
   .
   # Chronic congetive systolic heart failure
   LVEF 40% on [**3185-3-4**]. Taking somewhere between 40 and 80 daily. Also
   on lisinopril (either 10 or 40).
   - Hold lisinopril
   - Foley and monitor I&Os
   - Hold BB (Coreg) given recently started amlodipine, but will consider
   restarting tomorrow
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine 0.2 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold hydralazine and add back as necessary (was on 75 mg TID)
   - Hold lisinopril (10 or 40 ?) given kidney injury
   - Continue amlodipine 10 QD
   - consider restarting coreg tomorrow?
   .
   # FEN:
   # Access: PIV's
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with sub q heparin
   -Bowel regimen with colace, senna, bisacodyl
