TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:  Melena
   HPI:
   84-year old woman  with afib on coumadin, ischemic cardiomyopathy with
   EF 30-40%, presents to [**Hospital1 52**] ED after three episodes of melena starting
   on the afternoon of admission. The pt reports that she was running
   errands downtown this morning, and when she got home she saw black
   stool on the toilet paper. Pt reports that she has had long-standing
   problems with heartburn, and is unable to eat anything sour or spicey.
   Her heartburn has been worse over the past few weeks, and she said that
   two nights prior to admission she developed "terrible" heartburn where
   she felt the acid coming up her throat and "took everything" to try to
   relieve her pain, including maalox. She denies any recent additional
   NSAID use besides her daily baby aspirin. She denies vomiting, bright
   red blood per rectum, or retching. She does endorse GERD symptoms and
   abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant. She denies any prior
   episodes of black stools, and she notes that she does not take iron
   supplements.
   .
   Of note, the pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 52**] from [**Date range (1) 11851**] for
   evaluation of chest pain and dizziness. She three sets of negative
   cardiac enzymes and her chest pain was attributed to GERD. Her PPI was
   increased to [**Hospital1 **] and ranitidine was started. She notes that she was not
   able to take ranitidine because she felt unwell while taking it. Also
   of note, during the pt's recent admission (and on [**2875**] outpatient visit
   to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11852**] in GI) the pt refused EGD.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 66 138/64 16 99% RA. The pt was noted
   to have guaiac positive dark stool on rectal exam. She was given
   Pantoprazole 40 mg IV. GI was notified and requested that pt go to ICU
   for possible urgent EGD overnight and close monitoring of hct.
   .
   On the floor, the pt appears comfortable and is very talkative. She
   denies abdominal pain or GERD symptoms currently.

   Imaging: ECHO [**5-/2874**]
   Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium
   and left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity
   is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
   appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body
   of the right atrium or in the right atrial appendage No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. LV systolic function appears
   depressed. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild spontaneous left atrial echo contrast, but no
   intracardiac thrombus seen. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Advanced
   aortic atherosclerosis.

   COMMENTS:
   1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
   revealed two vessel native coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
   angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD had a 90%
   ostial lesion with distal filling via SVG-D1 with no significant
   disease.  The LCX had a 70% occlusion at the proximal portion of OM2
   with distal filling via SVG with no significant disease. The RCA had
   a widely patent proximal stent and 50% mid/distal vessel disease.
   2.  Graft angiography revealed a patent sequential SVG to D1 and OM2.
   The SVG to PDA was known occluded and not injected.
   3.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial
   hypertension of 149/70 mm Hg.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Normal SVG to D1 and OM2.
   CXR clear, no acute pulm process
   ECG: EKG: Sinus bradycardia, right axis, ST segments unchanged from
   prior EKG
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old woman with history of GERD, presents with melena.
   .
   # Melena: Differential includes PUD (including Dieulafoy's lesion),
   gastritis, esophagitis, or given history of dysphagia, esophageal mass.
   Ischemic colitis also possible given h/o CAD, but this would be
   unlikely to produce melanotic stools.  Varices and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1809**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 108**] tear
   unlikely given no history of liver disease or vomiting. Pt has refused
   EGD on past admission.
   - Active T+S
   - Pantoprazole gtt
   - F/u GI recs
   - NPO for possible EGD
   - Serial hct's (q6h)
   - Hold aspirin, coumadin
   - Two large-bore PIV's in place
   .
   # Chest pain: Per report pt complained of CP in ED, but on admission
   she reports LUQ pain that with reflux symptoms. Pt has known CAD, with
   most recent cath in [**2874**] showing 2-vessel coronary artery disease. On
   the pt's most recent admission CP was attributed to GERD, and EKG was
   unremarkable. Pt did take daily aspirin today, but did not take
   coumadin.
   - Hold aspirin for now given above bleeding
   - Complete rule-out MI, serial EKGs
   - PPI as above.
   - Continue statin, Lisinopril, Metoprolol
   - Hold Isosorbide given concern for bleeding
   .
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Pt is anticoagulated on coumadin, and
   is also on amiodarone for maintenance of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold coumadin
   - Hold on reversing with Vit K, if pt has additional melena, consider
   Vit K
   - D/w GI what INR threshold they will tolerate for EGD
   .
   # Ischemic cardiomyopathy: EF from echo in [**2874**] was 30-40%. Pt
   currently appears euvolemic, with no lower extremity edema.
   - Hold lasix given concern for GIB
   - Monitor I/O's
