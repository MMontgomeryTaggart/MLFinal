   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD who
   presents today with worsening shortness of breath.
   # Shortness of Breath
Admssion physical was notable for bronchospasm.
   Chest X-ray on admission was suggestive of fluid overload vs infiltrate
   vs COPD exacerbation vs MI induced HF decompensation. She is on bipap.
   BNP was elevated ([**Numeric Identifier 11868**]); though not terribly fluid overloaded on exam
   If PNA, then possibly
aspiration
   - continue nasal canula
   - gentle diuresis for goal 500-1L negative daily
   - lasix bolus, nebs. (home dose is 40 mg PO), dampening response to
   lasix
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime for presumed HAP x 24-48 hours until
   cx positive or other indication
   - f/u on Bcx, MRSA screen, Ucx
   - transfer to cardiology floor when stable
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Heart rate noted to be elevated to 130's. Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **], her out-patient cardiologist, switched her to digoxin recently.
   - continue metoprolol, coumadin (subtherapeutic - given additional abx,
   will likely rise INR)
   - continue low dose of 0.125 mg digoxin Q twice a week (Tuesday and
   Saturday).
   - trend INR, no indication to bridge with heparin gtt to therapeutic
   INR
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, creatinine was elevated
   at 2.5 from baseline in upper 1s. Throught to be
   pre-renal; patient was total body overloaded but intravascularly  dry,
   likely due to poor forward flow.  MM may contribute to this too.
   - renal dose meds
   - trend cr
   - consider urine lytes and urine eos if trending up
   .
   # Depressed mental status: baseline mental status is hard to assess,
   will retry in AM. likely [**2-11**] ARF/COPD exacerbation.
   - follow MS
   - may have to convert meds to IV if not confident in swallow status
   - clarify with [**Hospital3 **] re: how often she misses meds, meals
   # Coronary artery disease: Troponin was mildly elevated on
   admission at 0.09 in setting of ARF, likely a component of demand
   ischemia.
   - continue on aspirin, beta-blocker, atorvastatin
   .
   # Multiple myeloma--required no management.
   - trend creatinine and electrolytes
   .
   # Anemia: Perhaps due to multiple myeloma. Remained stable at
   baseline.
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: no seizure activity noted.  dilantin level checked
   and found to be within normal limits.
   - continued on dilantin at a dose of 250 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # COPD/chronic bronchitis: remained on home nebulizer treatment.
   - on steroid currently
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, cardiac diet

   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
