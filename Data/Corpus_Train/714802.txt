   s/p thrombectomy
   [**3310-5-8**]
   -FYI: patient home dose lasix 20mg being held
   -plan for graft revision as an add on case for OR on [**3310-5-9**]
   -NPO after midnight, coags in AM, repeat vancomycin level
   -pt continues on dextrose drip and insulin gtt
   -pt hypotensive to SBP 75 after receiving minoxidil.  Received 250ml NS
   bolus. Now refusing blood pressures.
   -Pt progressively refusing more care; first no blood pressures, then no
   finger sticks (insulin gtt off, last check 132), now removed monitor
   leads.
   PSYCH RECS (INITIAL):
-For now, pursue with procedures to which pt and HCP agree
-If he continues to refuse treatment, should consult legal
towards modifying guardianship to include substituted judgment.
Though he lacks capacity, we cannot take him to surgery without
having a judge declare him incompetent.  Continued discussion of
alternative options around his care, such that if he agrees to a
recommended treatment to which his HCP also agrees, would do it.
-Both pt's sister and father state that, were he thinking
clearly, he would want to have HD and would also agree to the
surgery to revise the graft; this has been witnessed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 372**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10902**] and by the primary team
-[**Month (only) 56**] use low dose quetiapine 12.5-25mg for agitation
-Pt cannot leave AMA
PSYCH RECS (FOLLOW-UP):
1) speak with his [**Last Name (LF) 1570**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] to confirm their support of surgery/treatment as
he is agreeing to care
2) in general, given his cognitive dysfunction, it would be best to have a guard
[**Doctor First Name **] appointment for medical decision making (not just admitted to a nursing faci
lity) given his processing difficulties and repeated problems with poor self car
3) he does not appear immediately at risk for suicide or harm to others and his
statements are more reflective of his frustration and mild confusion than true i
ntent to end his life

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**5-8**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Awaiting repeat procedure in OR
   today. Will need temp line placement if not able to secure working
   graft. Renal team aware
 no acute need for HD given electrolytes from
   yesterday PM so have held off overnight.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Plan for OR today for graft repair, ? temp line placement
   .
   # ESRD:  Per renal team, no acute indication for HD (mild hyperkalemia
   seen in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level).
   Currently without access.  Last HD prior to admission.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Plan for HD after thrombectomy via functioning graft or temporary HD
   line
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs). Last 5 FS all in 100s range; pt refused further FS overnight.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 257**] (appreciate recs)
   - Currently off insulin gtt, no sliding scale active at this time
   - will try to start his home dose insulin regimen when patient is able
   to eat
   - trend electrolytes if possible
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile.
   - On Vanco/Zosyn; plan for short course unless sx of worsening infxn
   (should define in POE); will consider discontinuing antibiotics and
   following up with a CXR as outpatient for any interval change.
   - F/U vanco level from yesterday afternoon elevated to 152, likely
   artifact. Will attempt re-check today if patient will agree to labs
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx (NGTD)
   - discuss today
s CXR with radiology re: RLL opacity
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, tele
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient actually hypotensive overnight at last check,
   refused further checks after midnight.
   - Trend BP if pt will allow
   - Hold home BP meds for now
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this morning to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient may need
   guardian.
   - F/U legal recs
   - F/U further psych recs
   .
   .
   # FEN: 75 cc/hr D5W until after surgery, replete electrolytes (K only
   if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will re-evaluate
   post-op

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 56M brittle DM (anti-insulin Ab+) c/b ESRD,
   dCHF now admitted with DKA and clotted AVG and possible pneumonia.
   Graft clotted yesterday, unable to dialyze. Refused revision this AM,
   eventually agreed after d/w me, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6896**], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11915**].
   Exam notable for Tm 98.4 BP 134/81 HR 70-90 RR 16 with sat 99 on 1LNC
   TBB +2.5L. Drowsy, minimally arousable but denies pain. Coarse BS B.
   RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. Chronic edema. Labs refused this AM.
   Agree with plan to manage DKA with lantus / ISS on PO diet after OR
   today, monitor FSG and AG. Will need HD following graft revision in OR.
   Will hold off on stress steroids for now, continue home prednisone. HTN
   - stable, resume BBL. Possible pneumonia - can d/c abx, outpt CXR f/u.
   Troponin leak, likely d/t ESRD - asa, statin, home HTN meds. Remainder
   of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
