   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 50**] yr old man presents with fevers and resp distress requiring non
   invasive ventilation
   1.       Resp Distress: in setting of HTN and volume overload with
   question of superimposed infection.. Agree with plans for BIPAP as a
   bridge while getting HD.
   Question of pneumothorax raised in initial CXR but not seen on follow
   up CXRs
 check serial CXR, low pressures. Thoracics following.
   2.       Fevers: DDX is fistula infection in setting of recent surgery
   in that will cover Vanco, Cefipime, Flagyl. To cover both nosocomial
   PNA and fistula infection.  Low threshold for Dapto if deteriorates
   sonce hx of [**Name (NI) 1549**] (swab only)  Transplant surgery was involved in the ED
   to  clear use of fistula and they agree- be sure to have them follow in
   house. Follow
   3.       ESRD: start on HD tonight in MICU, repeat K after HD run
   4.       HTN: in setting o fevers and underdiuresis. Restart home meds,
   getting HD< wean nitro drip as tolerates for BP less than 160. No ecg
   changes
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff.
