   Assessment and Plan
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (WITHOUT TAMPONADE)
   Ms. [**Known patient lastname 14209**] is a 76 YOF with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p DES,
   systolic CHF (Ef 25-30%) who presented for elective primary prevention
   ICD and was found to have pericardial effusion post op.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: [**Month (only) 47**] have been caused by local trauma during
   procedure.  Concern is for ICD perforation.  Patient has been
   hemodynamically stable
   -- f/u repeat Echo in am
   -- f/u repeat CXR in am
   -- follow pulsus
   -- if no evidence of worsening effusion, consider restarting metoprolol
   and diovan and call out to floor
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: Status post DES to ramus. No symptoms of
   angina with exertion.  No chest pain currently.
   -- continue aspirin 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg
   .
   # systolic CHF:  Thought to be non-ischemic.  Pt is NYHA [**Name (NI) **] and is
   currently euvolemic.  Pt denies swelling or orthopnea.  Last echo
   showed EF 25-30%.  Now S/P ICD for primary prevention of Vfib arrest.
   -- held diovan and metoprolol as above, but will plan to restart when
   pt demonstrates she is stable.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient has baseline LBBB.  [**Company 1958**] PM ICD shows a sensed,
   biV paced at rate of 60 bpm
   -- replete lytes PRN K > 4, Mg > 2
   -- continue cafazolin/cephalexin for one week
   .
   #  Hyperlipidemia:
   -- continue simvastatin
   .
   #  Hypertension: Pt is currently normotensive.
   -- holding metoprolol and diovan as above but will plan to restart as
   soon as safe
   .
   #  GERD:
   --continue zantac
   .
   .
   FEN:  cardiac healthy
