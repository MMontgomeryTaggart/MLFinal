Chief Complaint: VF arrest.
   24 Hour Events:
   - 5:30P developed bigemeny for 15 mins, lytes okay, resolved
   spontaneously
   - dilantin stopped
   - ET tube changed from 6 to 8 (received paralytic for this)
   - ET tube advanced, still seems 6.6cm above, need to f/u final read
   - CXR demonstrates right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe
   collapse
   - increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements over course of day; adjusted
   vent settings without significant improvement. Added fentanyl to
   increase sedation, not effective. Re-paralysed.
   - He was desynchronous with the ventilator, so re-paralysed.
   Unfortunately, Neurology came by when ETT was being changed, and
   paralytics had been started more by protocol than by necessity, it
   would seem. Neurology ask that we hold paralysis and then sedation
   before they come in the morning, so that they can evaluate more
   usefully.
   - discussed with IP; suggest no major changes, consider pulm consult
   tomorrow
   - pt spiked fever to 104, started to develop brown sputum purulent
   appaering, despite lack of infiltrate we started emperic
   vanc/zosyn/levo given profound hypoxia
   - now sputum growing GNRs 4+ in a good sample, good thing we started

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
      Neurology have been very helpful in understanding deficits and
   prognosis. He has at least some preserved medullary function, as
   evidenced by breathing well on pressure support. He had a sluggish
   response to caloric stimulation, but is otherwise without other
   evidence of pontine/midbrain function. No evidence of cortical
   function. Per Neurology, good outcome can not be expected
 please see
   their note.
   - Discuss with family
   - Appreciate Neurology input as above
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 396**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now
   .

   - No fluid for now
