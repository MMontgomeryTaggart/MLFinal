Chief Complaint:  Transfer for hypercarbic resp failure
   HPI:
   89 year old female with PMH dCHF, Afib, CAD, DM2 who was admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4201**] on [**5-30**] for fatigue, cough, SOB and transferred to CCU for
   tachynpnea and hypoxia.  She was treated for presumed PNA with levaquin
   and diuresed with torsemide (maintained even) given clinical exam and
   elevated BNP (6900).  She developed acute renal failure w Cr bump to
   1.7.  Last night was lethargic and sitting upright.  Triggered at 9am
   today for tachynpea and hypoxia.  O2 sat 87% 4L w RR 32-36.  ABG
   7.3/90/61 w HCO3 46.
   .
   On my eval, she denied any localizing sx - no HA, neck pain, CP, SOB,
   abd pain.  She has had loose stool.  She is fatigued.

   No AS but thickened leaflets.  Mod MS (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid

   hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

   No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. MIBI: 1) Mild,
   reversible perfusion defect of the lateral wall. 2) Right
   ventricular prominence. 3) Increased lung uptake of thallium,
   suggestive of CHF. 4) No left ventricular wall motion abnormalities.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   89 yo F with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic CHF, CAD, who
   is transferred to CCU for tachynpnea, hypercarbia, hypoxia, and
   somnulence.
   .
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: She has baseline hypercarbia and her
   compensation is almost appropriate (3.5 rise HCO3 for every 10 rise in
   pCO2).  Acute on chronic exacerbation multifactorial but I think likely
   component of worsening diastolic dysfunction with known MS and MR.  She
   does not have clear PNA on CXR and she did not appear to have ACS on
   presentation.  Other etiologies include [**2-21**] worsening pulmonary
   hypertension, COPD (doubtful given lack of hx), PE (unlikely given
   elevated INR), pericardial effusion (unlikely given lack of hemodyamic
   compromise), or medication effect (no known sedatives given).  Rx as
   below.  If no improvement after diuresis or rate control, will start
   CPAP.
   .
   # dCHF: Will try to improve filling with diuresis and rate control.
   Would like to afterload reduce her but will hold off given worsening
   renal dysfunction. Her underlying MS [**First Name (Titles) 167**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] hemodynamics with
   tachycardia.
   - rate control with metop 50 TID plus 5 IV now.  Goal HR 60-70.
   Uptitrate as able
   - diurese with lasix if able.
   - reeval w echo today
   - continue torsemide 60
   - hold spironolactone given hyperkalemia
   .
   # valvular disease: hx of mod MS and mod/severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  Will obtain
   echo today.  Rx dCHF as above.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: rate control with BB and uptitrate as able.
   Continue digoxin for now but check level given worsening renal
   function.
   - INR was elevated on admit.  now s/p vit K.  Will hold coumadin and
   monitor for bleeding.
   .
   # Coronary vasc: Trop flat on admit and no EKG changes suggestive of
   new ischemia.
   .
   # ? PNA: not clear on CXR or history.  Will finish course of levaquin.
   Will add vanco for extra coverage only if fevers or change in sputum.
   .
   # ? COPD: No known hx but she does appear to have a chronic hypercarbia
   and hx of tobb.  Will try nebs.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: up to 1.7 from baseline 1.2.  FeNA was 2.5
   yesterday (but with diuretics) suggesting prerenal vs ATN.  Although
   she appears intravascularly dry, will dry diuresis now to improve
   ventilation.
   - monitor potassium and other lytes.  EKG without peaked T waves.
   - renally dose
   - patient's family said that she would NOT want dialysis even for short
   period.
   .
   # HTN: BP currently 130s/60s. uptitrate metop as able.
   .
   # HL: Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   # Dementia: Continue donepezil
   .
   # DM: HISS
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: might be [**2-21**] intravascularly dry.  If diuresis does
   not improve her resp status, consider gentle hydration.
   .
   FEN:NPO for now.
   ACCESS: PIV's  x2.  Will consider central access once INR down.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR
   -Pain management with tylenol PRN pain
   -Bowel regimen
