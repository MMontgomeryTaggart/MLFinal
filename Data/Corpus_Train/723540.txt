Chief Complaint:  hematemesis
   HPI:
   58 y/o M with history of alcoholic cirrhosis (grade I varices on
   nadolol, recent GI bleed at [**Location (un) 100**], mutliple paracentesis, never had
   SBP) who presented with hepatic encephalopathy, developed hematemesis
   while on [**Doctor Last Name 2448**]-[**Doctor Last Name 3754**], and transferred to ICU for further management.
   .
   He initially presented with dyspnea for the past few days to weeks and
   altered mental status. No ligthheadedness, cough, fever. Complains of
   abdominal pain to palpation. Of note, the patient reports still
   drinking. He says his last drink was [**3209-4-29**].
   .
   In the ER, intial vitals 97.3, BP 110/50, 70, 18, 96% RA. he was given
   2L NS, Kayexalate 30g PO, Lactulose 30mg PO, Levofloxacin 750mg IVx1
   and flagyl 500mg IV x1 to treat hepatic encephalopathy and prophylaxis
   for SBP.
   .
   He was empirically treated with ceftriaxone. Patient underwent a
   paracentesis on [**3209-5-4**] that revealed 134 WBC in ascitic fluid. In the
   evening of [**3209-5-4**] he vomited up about 50 cc of bright red blood. SBP

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 58 y/o M with history of ETOH cirrhosis admitted with
   encephalopathy and acute renal failure, now s/p hematemesis prompting
   MICU transfer.
   # GI bleed: with hematemesis, likely from esophageal bleed. Repeat Hct
   was stable at 30. Vital signs stable.
   - serial Hcts; transfuse blood products as needed
   - PPI and octreotide infusion
   - monitor closely for any sign of bleed
   - keep type & screen active
   .
   # Cirrhosis/hepatic encephalopathy: still confused. S/p paracentesis
   with unremarkable ascitic fluid.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin, pentoxifylline
   - hold nadolol given ongoing GI bleed
   - continue ceftriaxone for now for empiric SBP treatment; consider
   d/c'ing once more clinically stable and cx unremarkable
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 3.2 on admission from baseline of 1.2/1.0, trending
   down to 1.6 with IVF and albumin. Unlikely hepatorenal syndrome.
   - continue to trend renal labs
   - hold diuretics
   .
   # Diabetes type II:
   - continue home insulin
   .
   # COPD:
   - continue nebs
   .
   # H/o HTN: currently normotensive, will hold antihypertensives given
   ARF and GI bleed.
   .
   # GERD: PPI
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now

   # Ppx: pneumoboots

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 58M ESLD / ethanol, varicies, encephalopathy
   transferred from F10 to MICU for hematemesis / UGIB. Vomitted 50cc BRB
   yesterday but HD stable and HCT 35 to 28, 29 on repeat. No blood
   overnight.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.0 BP 120/30 HR 77 RR 18 with sat 99 on RA.
   Anisocoria. Encephalopathic. RRR s1s2. CTAB. Soft +BS. No edema. Labs
   notable for WBC 9K, HCT 30, 5.9K+ , Cr 1.8 (down), INR 1.9.
   Agree with plan to manage likely variceal bleeding with PPI IV,
   octreotide, goal HCT >27, and EGD in ICU. For concern of SBP - tap
   negative, will start cipro for prophylaxis and d/c CTX. ARF is
   improving with IVF. Encephalopathy is stable per report, will continue
   lactulose / rifax when tolerating POs. COPD without flare - continue
   MDI rx and pulm hygeine per routine. Full. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 35 min
