Chief Complaint:  presumed septic shock
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Pt is a 79 y.o male w/ ischemic CM, CKD, DM, PVD, afib. Recent d/c from
   OSH on [**2993-7-18**] to [**Hospital 652**] Rehab who was admitted to MICU on [**7-19**] after
   he was found unresponsive on the bedpan. Brief MICU stay for
   monitoring, but at that time little suspicion for infection.
   Unresponsiveness was attributed to possible syncope related to
   tachy-brady syndrome. he was covered empirically with vanco + levoflox,
   however.
   On the night of [**7-22**] pt was noted to be oliguric and received IVF,
   which were reduced when increased oxygen requirement was noted.
   Additionally, a rising WBC ct was also noted.  Other hospital events
   included coffee-grounds emesis on [**7-22**] for which an eventual EGD has
   been planned for.
   Of note, on pt's OSH hospitalization in early [**Month (only) 91**], he developed a MRSA
   bactermia with an unclear source. A TEE was negative for endocarditis
   and repeat cultures remained negative; he was treated w/ vancomycin IV.
   He did also have a Klebsiella and Stenotrophomonas-positive sputum
   sample, which was treated with levofloxacin.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo male w/ tachy-brady syndrome, ischemic CM, s/p bioprosthetic AVR,
   CKD, admitted to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**7-19**] w/ possible syncope, and transferred to
   the MICU today for hypotension and leukocytosis concerning for severe
   sepsis vs septic shock, also with hypoxemic respiratory distress
   possibly related to pneumonia +/- pulmonary edema.
   1. Shock: most likely due to sepsis but w/ underlying ischemic CM
   -place R IJ CVC, place a line
   -IVF resuscitation and pressor for MAP and CVP goals
   -follow lactate and central venous O2 sats
   -possible repeat TTE or TEE
   2. Severe Sepsis (shock state): Possible etiologies include line
   sepsis, pneumonia, prostethic valve endocarditis, c. diff.
   - vanco/zosyn/levoflox/flagyl to cover broadly for bacterial infections
   and c. diff
   - f/u sensitivities of Stenotrophomonas and Klebsiella from OSH as we
   will want to cover for these as well.
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - consider repeat TTE or TEE
   - check glucan
   3.  Hypoxemic respiratory distress: related to edema plus possible
   infection.
   - consider bipap vs intubation if he has worsening respiratory status
   - infectious mgmt as above
   4.  Abd distension/ coffee-grounds emesis: KUB shows significant
   gastric distention.
   - NGT to suction
   - serial KUBs
   - per GI plan on EGD when more stable
   5. Possible syncope:  suspecting tachy-brady as related to event. Ruled
   out for ACS already.
   - Cards had planned on pacer at some point
   - f/u carotid u/s recommended by cards
   -tele monitoring
   6. Anticoagulation: for afib
   - holding coumadin given coffee-grounds emesis
   7. CAD/CABG/AVR: holding BB for now, will give statin; holding ASA for
   now
   Remainder of plan as per housestaff note
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: npo for now
   Glycemic Control: Blood sugar well controlled
   Lines / Intubation:
   PICC Line - [**2993-7-23**] 12:00 PM
   Comments: to get CVC and have PICC pulled
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: Boots

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I was physically present with the resident team on this date for
   discussion of the above history, exam and assessment and plan with
   which I agree.  I independently examined the patient and would add the
   following comments:
   79 yo male with [**Last Name (un) **] CM, tachy-brady syndrome, CKD, DM, HTN,
   hypothyroidism recently at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 76**] in [**Month (only) 91**] for tachy-brady
   syndrome, hospitalization also notable for MRSA bacteremia of unclear
   source, Klebsiella and stenotrophomonas PNA. Discharged to rehab [**7-18**];
   readmitted [**7-19**] to ICU when found to be unresponsive on the bed pan. He
   was briefly covered with Vanc/Levaquin and thought to have syncope
   either tachy brady or syncope.
   To the floor-developed coffee grds emesis with EGD planned by GI. Cards
   consult was called regarding tachy-brady syndrome. He continued to have
   a leukocytosis and yesterday became oliguric. With attempted fluid
   resuscitation he became hypoxic and today, hypotension with SBP's to
   the 70's
   PMHx: tachy-brady syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, hx Ao stenosis s/p
   bioprosthetic valve (TEE [**7-11**] negative), HTN, afib, asthma, DM
   Non smoker, nondrinker
    PE:
   Ill appearing male, mildly tachypneic
   Lungs: Rhonchorous with decreased BS
   Irreg. Irreg USB systolic murmur
   Abd: soft, nt; mildly distended,  hypoactive bs
   Ext: cool, no peripheral edema
   Skin: multiple scattered ecchymoses
   RUE PICC
   WBC 21.6 with 90% N
   Bicarb down to 15
   AG 15, lactate 1.6
   KUB and CXR: bilateral effusions
   Cx: All Bd Cx's NGTD ([**2903-7-19**])
   Imp:
   79 yo male with recent hospitalization for MRSA bacteremia of unclear
   source, and Stenotrophomonas PNA- now with evolving sepsis with
   leukocytosis, acidosis, hypotension
   1. shock: sepsis most likely etiology-
   IJ placed, plan a-line for invasive monitoring
   Check CVP and fluid resuscitate- central venous sats and lactate
   Re-check Echo
   Neo to maintain MAP>65
    2. Sepsis: source not entirely clear. Possibilites include line,
   resistant PNA; Cdiff; GI source
   Expand to Vanc/Cefipime/cipro/flagyl
   CVL placed and will pull PICC
   CT torso if pt
s status stabilizes, or if he gets intubated
    3. Hypoxic respiratory distress: pulm edema (cardiogenic vs
   non-cardiogenic)-
   support with supplemental oxygen and may require NIPPV or  intubation
    4. Coffee grds emesis/distension: NG tube to suction, montior
   abdominal exams
   5. Afib: anticoauglation being held due to coffee grds emesis. HR
   control acceptable
   Pt is critically ill: Total time spent: 50 minutes.
