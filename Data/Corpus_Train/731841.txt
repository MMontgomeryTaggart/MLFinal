   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3031**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of chronic
   hyponatremia attributed to SIADH, chronic bronchitis, moderate aortic
   stenosis, htn admitted for hyponatremia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely acute on chronic hyponatremia attributed to
   SIADH exacerbation.  Possible causes include recent pain, dietary
   indiscretion (should be fluid restricted), infection. Current Na worse
   than most recent baseline of 125-130.  TSH and cortisol checks have
   been normal. Prior chest and head imaging has been unrevealing. Last CT
   chest [**5-/2526**] without masses. last CT head [**9-/2525**] without masses.  CXR
   here unremarkable. Appears euvolemic. Normal BUN/Cr argues against
   hypovolemia.
   - q6 lytes
   - fluid restriction 1000 cc/day
   - if worsening despite fluid restriction, can cosider hypertonic saline
   - consider salt tabs
   .
   # SOB: history of chronic bronchitis and subjective SOB by history. Has
   had increased need for albuterol inhaler; may be secondary to increased
   physical activity at rehabilitation. Currently saturating well on RA
   without any significant abnormalities on CXR.
   - albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - cont fluticasone
   - hold off on antibiotics for now
   -control pain
   .
   # bilateral shoulder/arm pain: s/p recent fall. Came from rehab. Known
   bilat rotator cuff injuries. No fractures by report from survey
   performed at St Es after fall. (Note OSH records in chart)
   - tylenol prn
   - ultram prn
   - lidocaine patches
   .
   # HTN: suboptimally controlled currently
   - cont valsartan, metoprolol
   .
   # chronic diastolic CHF: Likely contribution of known AS with LVH on
   most recent ECHO. Reasonable BP control currently. No evidence of
   active ischemia. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - BP and HR control
   .
   # ? CAD: patient carries a history of CAD for unclear reasons as he has
   never had a positive stress test nor cardiac catheterization, has no
   WMA on ECHO, and has no QWs on ECG.
   - cont home plavix for now
   - cont statin, beta blocker, Imdur
   .
   # PUD: h/o H pylori in past. Unclear if treated. Scheduled for breath
   test as [**Year (4 digits) 606**].
   - cont PPI, H2B, Maalox
   - urease breath test as outpatient
   .
   # anemia: BL Hct 28-33.  At most recent baseline. No evidence of
   bleeding. Iron studies, B12, folate normal 4/[**2526**].
   - Qday CBC
   .
   # rash: per sons report, has significant eczema history and uses
   moisturizing cream [**Hospital1 **].
   - moisturize [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # skin cancer on L chin: scheduled for [**Hospital1 606**] follow up per sons report.
   -[**Name2 (NI) 606**] f/u
   .
   # FEN: regular diet; fluid restrict; salt tabs. Replete K and Mg as
   needed.
   - Ocuvite
   .
   # PPx: PPI, heparin sc. Increase bowel regimen as pt notes
   constipation.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV
   .
   # CODE: FULL, confirmed with patient
