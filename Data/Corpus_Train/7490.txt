any of this.


Family History:
Father was an alcoholic.

Physical Exam:
39M well known to [**Hospital1 18**] for multiple alcohol related admissions,
BIBA for [**Last Name (un) 10602**] unresponsive on a park bench.



The patient states that today he got back together with his
long-term girlfriend/wife who brought him a family sized bottle
of Listerine in the mall and then layed on bench and became
unresponsive.  He states that they began to fight and then she
beat him about the head and chest with his own cane.  She left
and at a time distant to the assault he passed out on a park
bench.  He states that he drank more of the listerine, "being
the bigger man."



EMS arrived and finger stick was found to be in the 150's. In
the ER he opened his eyes and was able to communicate
appropriately despite slurred speech. He adamantly claimed that
he only drank listerine, and no other drugs.  Initial vitals
were 99.1 100 144/78 20 100%.

.

Plan was for CIWA and observation until sober re-evaluation.
However after several hours in observation he began to withdraw
and score on CIWA for tremulousness and tachycardia.  Given his
seizure history and requirement of 6mg Ativan over an hour he
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name **].

.



On arrival here, he is alert, interactive and asking for pain
meds

.

Of note Mr [**Known patient lastname 27019**] has had multiple recent admissions as
follows:

- [**Hospital1 18**] ICU w/ d/c AMA on [**10-31**] for presumed isopropyl alcohol
intoxication and admission from [**Date range (1) 27030**] to [**Hospital1 2148**] for presumed
aspiration pneumonia on cefpodoxime/azithromycin

- [**Hospital1 18**] [**11-14**] for fevers, CP, and productive cough cough.

.

- [**Hospital1 18**] ICU from [**10-30**] to [**10-31**]. Patient was visiting his wife
[**Name (NI) **] in the ICU when he was noted to become unresponsive.

- Durring his hospitalization [**11-14**] he called his [**Company 189**] PCP and
complained of not getting enough pain meds, he then told his PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] "if he didnt give him more pain meds he would put him in as
much pain as he ([**Known patient firstname **]) was already in."  This resulted in the
patient being banned from [**Hospital 189**] clinic, patient relations
involvement and an agreement by which Mr. [**Known patient lastname 27019**] is not
allowed to get any outpatient prescriptions from [**Hospital1 **].

[**3315-11-23**] 06:15AM BLOOD Osmolal-290

Brief Hospital Course:
39M with complicated social situation and multiple [**Hospital1 18**]
admission for ingestions of alcohol and its related denatured
counterparts.

.

Listerine Ingestion:

Per the ingredient list Listerine is 40% etoh and also includes
a salicylate.  Mr [**Known patient lastname 27031**] ETOH level on admission to the ICU
was 85 while his salicylate level was negative.  It is likely
that ETOH was driving all of his assorted issues.  This likely
explained his lowish anion gap metabolic acidosis on admission.
Using the formula that ETOH is corrected for in the osmolar gap
by dividing by 3.8, his osmolar gap is accounted for by his ETOH
level, making coingestion with isopropanol or ethylene glycol
much less likely.  He scored only once on CIWA, over 18 hours
ago, and currently has normal vital signs.  We will plan for
discharge.

- Per prior agreement he will not be discharged with
prescriptions for any medications
.
Hypoxia:
Suspect medication induced hypoventilion c/b splinting leading
to increased CO2 and thus increased CO2 admixture via the
alveolar gas equation, stably in the low 90's overnight while
asleep. Resolved morning of discharge.
.
Pain control:
This patient is a terrible candidate for opiates, and refuses
nsaids, we used low dose tylenol and would not give opiates in
any situation if possible.  Despite sleeping easily, he
continued to request fioricet/fioranol for his migraines when he
awakened, but this medication was not in his medication discarge
list.  He was given tylenol.
.
Rib Pain:
No hct drop to raise c/f splenic rupture, no fractured ribs, no
ptx
.
Multiple Psychiatric diagnoses:
Patient was continued on his home regimen, he should continue
with his home supply at home.
.
?Seizure d/o history:
.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] recent note calls into question his seizure
history; however, the patient comes in with a positive
barbiturate level.   Given his lack of seizure disorders and
previous plans, we will discharge him without a prescription for
phenobarb.

.

Dicharge planning:

Please refer to the below note from Chief Resident [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
regarding his rules for discharge.
.
" After discussion with the patient and his consulting services,
we will not provide prescriptions for any of his reported home
medication including clonazepam, carbamazepine, amitriptyline,
olanzapine or mirtazapine. At this time, the risk of significant
toxicity including death, in the setting of his [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17350**]
substance abuse is greater the risk of any potential withdrawal
symptoms.
.
After discussion with neurology we will provide the patient with
a short duration of phenobarbital with planned Neurology Access
Clinic follow up."
