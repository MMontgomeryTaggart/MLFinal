INDICATIONS:  This 72-year-old lady with severe peripheral
vascular disease has previously had a left axillary-bifemoral
graft. This has been revised a couple of times. She recently
developed recurrent symptoms of claudication and early, mild
ischemic rest pain in her left foot. Duplex ultrasound
suggested a stenosis at the proximal anastomosis of the
axillary graft to the axillary artery and also a focal high-
grade stenosis in the superficial femoral artery just distal
to the distal anastomosis on the left side. This was
confirmed by arteriography through a left brachial approach a
couple of weeks ago. She is now undergoing definitive
treatment.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Under adequate general
endotracheal anesthesia, the left groin was prepped and
draped in the usual sterile fashion. A lateral incision was
made through the old incision, incising the deep fascia and
reflecting the proximal sartorius muscle. The superficial
femoral artery was then dissected free underneath the muscle
and encircled with vessel loops proximally and distally. The
artery had no pulse present within it at all but was very
soft. A longitudinal incision was made just proximal to the
groin incision, directly over the axillary femoral graft, at
about the level of the iliac crest before it entered the
groin. The graft was dissected free here and encircled with
vessel loops proximally and distally. A number of rings were
removed from the graft, and a subcutaneous tunnel was created
across the inguinal ligament and down to the level of the
femoral dissection done previously. The C-arm was then draped
and rolled into place. The axillary-femoral graft was
punctured with a Cook needle, a wire advanced into the graft
under fluoroscopy, and a 7-French sheath placed. We then
directed an angled glide wire into the axillary artery
proximal to the proximal anastomosis and, over this, advanced
a Omni Flush catheter, which was then connected to the power
injector. Arteriography confirmed the presence of what
appeared to be only about a 50%-60% stenosis of the
anastomosis into the origin of the left axillary graft;
however, the ultrasound had suggested a far more significant
stenosis, and we had noted a weak pulse in the axillary-
femoral graft when dissecting it free. We then did an
exchange for a stiffer wire and advanced a 6 x 40 angioplasty
balloon up, so that most was in the graft, with just a small
amount crossing into the axillary artery. This balloon was
then inflated to a high pressure of about 20 atmospheres. We
then replaced the Omni Flush catheter and shot a completion
arteriogram, which showed complete resolution of the waist
previously seen in the graft. A catheter was then placed and
connected to a pressure transducer and a pull-back pressure
done, which showed about a 5-mm systolic pressure gradient
across the anastomosis, with no change in diastolic blood
pressures, and about a 2- to 3-mm drop in the mean arterial
pressure. We thought that this was satisfactory. We then
returned our attention to the groin. Proximal and distal
control was obtained on the axillary-femoral graft. The
sheath was removed and the sheath puncture extended
proximally and distally into an arteriotomy. A 6-mm, thin-
walled, ringed PTFE graft was taken and spatulated and an end-
to-side anastomosis fashioned between the new graft and old
graft with running continuous 6-0 [**Doctor Last Name 4660**]-Tex sutures from
either end. When this anastomosis was completed, the suture
holes were sealed with BioGlue. Flow was tested through the
new conduit and found to be excellent. It was pulled through
the tunnel at the proximity with the superficial femoral
artery, where proximal-distal control was again obtained, and
a longitudinal arteriotomy was made. Antegrade bleeding was
extremely poor, but backbleeding was brisk. The distal end of
the graft was trimmed and spatulated appropriately and a 2nd
end-to-side anastomosis fashioned, again with 6-0 [**Doctor Last Name 4660**]-Tex
sutures. Flow was reestablished without difficulty. The
superficial femoral artery plumped up nicely and had a
strongly triphasic Doppler signal noted within it. Hemostasis
was then secured, the heparin was fully reversed with
protamine, and the wounds were closed in layers with 3-0
Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures. Dermabond skin
dressing was applied over the wounds. The patient tolerated
this procedure well and, upon awakening, being extubated, was
taken to the recovery room in stable condition. All counts
reported correct.
