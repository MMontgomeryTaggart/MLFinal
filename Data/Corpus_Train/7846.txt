CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Coronary artery disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year old
male with known coronary artery disease status post inferior
myocardial infarction and status post stenting of the right
coronary artery in [**2515-10-26**].  The catheterization at
that time also demonstrated multiple lesions of the left
anterior descending and left circumflex.  Subsequently he was
stable and underwent a second catheterization in [**2516-10-25**] because of more recurrent chest pain, which showed good
result in the right coronary artery, no change in the left
coronary artery lesion.  Since then he continued on a stable
course until the past week when he developed progressive
episodes of chest pain.  The pain began to occur at rest and
it was not relieved with Nitroglycerin sublingual.  He was
promptly brought to [**Hospital1 69**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post right coronary artery stenting in [**2515-10-26**].
2.  Status post left ankle surgery.

ALLERGIES:   Include Vicodin and question of an intravenous

hematocrit of 39, platelets of 216.  Sodium of 143, potassium
of 4.5, BUN of 14, creatinine of 1.2, glucose of 69, INR 1.0.

EKG was significant for normal sinus rhythm with normal axis.
No evidence of ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission, the patient
underwent cardiac catheterization.  This revealed 90%
stenosis of the right coronary artery, 70% stenosis of the
proximal left anterior descending, mid-LAD, and 70% stenosis
of the diagonal 1, 70% stenosis of the proximal circumflex
and 90% stenosis of the obtuse marginal 1.

On hospital day two, the patient went to the Operating Room

He had left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to diagonal, saphenous vein
