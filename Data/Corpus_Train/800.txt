CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Gastric varices.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
male with past medical history of chronic hepatitis B
complicated by cirrhosis, portal hypertension, gastric
varices, and hepatic encephalopathy (failed interferon and
lamivudine therapy in the past and now on Hepsera for
hepatitis B), initially transferred from [**Hospital3 412**]
Hospital on [**2537-2-15**] in preparation for TIPS procedure.  The
patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 412**] Hospital with 1-week
history of right-sided abdominal pain, episode of large
bloody emesis with clots and positive melena.  EGD on
[**2537-2-4**] at the outside hospital revealed large gastric
varices with dark blood in the stomach and duodenum, but no
active bleeding.  On [**2537-2-13**], the patient became obtunded
and was given octreotide drip and lactulose for hepatic
encephalopathy.  Surgery was consulted who recommended TIPS.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU and was
somnolent on arrival.  EGD performed on [**2537-2-16**], showed no
esophageal varices, 2 erosions in the antrum with clean
bases, no recent bleed, appearance consistent with portal
gastropathy; large mass of gastric varices in the
fundus/cardia.  NG lavage on [**2537-2-15**] yielded blood-tinged
sputum, but hematocrit was unchanged at 29, hemodynamically
stable.  TIPS procedure was deferred until Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
returned from vacation on [**2537-2-21**] or until rebleeding
occurs.  Currently, the patient is without complaints.  He is
feeling well with no shortness of breath, no nausea or
vomiting, no abdominal pain, no fevers or chills, no
confusion, no bright red blood per rectum.  He is tolerating
clear diet.  Since the TIPS procedure was not performed, the
patient is now transferred to the medicine floor for further
management.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 61-year-old male with past medical
history of chronic hepatitis B complicated by cirrhosis,
portal gastropathy, transferred from outside hospital with
history of GI bleed and evidence of gastric varices here with
EGD, now awaiting possible TIPS procedure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  GI bleed/gastric varices:  The patient was
initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with a history of gastric varices
and bleeding and was awaiting a TIPS procedure.  However,
given the risk, the patient had chosen to defer the TIPS
procedure until he could further discuss the procedure with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] when he returns from vacation on [**2537-2-21**].  The
patient also decided that he would have that procedure if he
had an episode of rebleeding.  He was thus transferred to the
floor for monitoring until Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] could return from
vacation and then a decision would be made regarding TIPS
procedure.  His hematocrits were followed b.i.d. and they
were stable.  The patient was at high risk for bleeding given
his severe gastropathy and portal hypertension, known varices
and a recent bleed.  The patient was maintained on IV
Protonix and IV octreotide initially on transfer to the
medicine floor, and his hematocrit and platelet count were
monitored closely.  His hematocrit remained stable in the 28-
30 range as well as his platelet count.  On [**2537-2-19**], the
patient's IV octreotide was discontinued since he had already
completed a 5-day course, and the patient continued to have a
stable hematocrit with no evidence of acute bleeding and
remained hemodynamically stable.  However, on [**2537-2-20**] in the
morning, the patient had an episode of frank melena, moderate
to large amount.  He was without complaints with no dizziness
or lightheadedness, and was sitting comfortably, and was
hemodynamically stable with his blood pressure in the 110
range and his pulse 62.  NG lavage was then performed with
300 cc of normal saline, which did not reveal any bright red
blood, but did show clots and appearance of blood tinged
saline that was not clearing.  The patient's hematocrit that
morning dropped from 28.5 to 26.7, and his INR was 1.8.  The
patient was evaluated immediately by the GI service, who had
been following the patient during his entire hospital course.
The patient's octreotide was restarted with a 100 mcg bolus
and then a constant infusion.  He was transfused 2 units of
packed red blood cells and was transferred to the MICU for
urgent TIPS procedure.  The ciprofloxacin was also restarted
for SBP prophylaxis, and the patient was kept on n.p.o.

Overnight on [**2537-2-20**], a TIPS procedure was performed, but
was unsuccessful, and the patient had a repeat TIPS procedure
performed on [**2537-2-21**] morning.  His hematocrit remained
stable in the MICU in the 29-30 range, and he remained on the
octreotide drip as well as Protonix.  The patient then
underwent a successful TIPS procedure on [**2537-2-21**], although
was a technically complicated procedure.  Although, the TIPS
was ultimately successful with good flow and positive
successful occlusion of both gastric shunts, one splenorenal
shunt and with minimal residual flow in the second
splenorenal shunt.  The procedure appear to be very
technically difficult as evidenced by the operative note on
[**2537-2-21**].  The procedure required several cc of alcohol
injection into the varices, several placements of
embolization coils and stents as well as 350 cc of contrast.
Liver ultrasound showed low slow flow in the diminutive
portal [**Last Name (LF) 5628**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] to wall flow in the TIPS, and appropriate
reversal of the right and left portal veins.  Since the
patient had remained hemodynamically stable in the MICU and
his hematocrit remained stable, he was transferred from the
MICU to the floor again for further monitoring.  The patient
continued to have melena, although this was about two to
three episodes of melena per day and was thought to be likely
from old blood prior to the procedure and postprocedure.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable and his hematocrit
remained stable at 27-30.  The liver team was aware of his
melena and felt that this was appropriate post procedure.
The patient received another unit of packed red blood cells
during his hospital course.  The patient was continued on IV
octreotide, which was discontinued on [**2537-2-25**] after a total
of 5-day course.  His hematocrit was monitored b.i.d. and
remained stable on the 27-30 range.  The patient continued to
have black stools over the last several days of his hospital
course, but not as large as previously noted and no bright
red blood streaks.  The liver team was aware, and the liver
attending suggested that the patient would most likely have
small amounts of melena from old blood prior to the procedure
and post procedure, and this melena could persist for as long
as 1 week after the procedure.  The patient showed no
evidence of hemolysis post TIPS, with improved total
bilirubin and baseline INR at 1.8 and stable hematocrit.  He
tolerated.  He was switched to a low-sodium diet and
tolerated this well, and showed no further episodes of
increased melena now that he was off the octreotide.  The
patient continued to have an elevated INR, but was not
responsive to repeated attempts with vitamin K.  Ultimately,
after consultation with the liver service, interventional
radiology, and the primary medicine team, it was decided that
the patient was stable for discharge on [**2537-2-26**], and would
have a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and ultrasound
with Doppler in approximately 10 days after discharge as well
as hematocrit check later on in the week.

Cirrhosis/portal hypertension:  The patient had a history of
hepatitis B cirrhosis with failed therapies of interferon and
lamivudine in the past and was started recently on adefovir.
He was continued on a adefovir throughout his hospital
course.  The patient previously was on outpatient Aldactone,
but since he had no ascites and no evidence of fluid
overload, this medication was deferred into the outpatient
setting and this can be restarted as an outpatient when the
patient's acute issues resolve.  The patient remained alert
and oriented during his entire hospital course.  His
lactulose was restarted to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
The patient was continued on Cipro for SBP prophylaxis, and
his liver function tests remained stable.

Coagulopathy:  The patient had an elevated PT and INR thought
secondary to hepatic failure, but remained stable in the 1.7
to 1.9 range.  The patient did not respond to large doses of
vitamin K subcutaneus and p.o.

Cough:  The patient had a persistent cough throughout his
hospital course, which on discharge improved.  He had
repeated chest x-rays, which were clear and showed no signs
of infiltrate.  He had no symptoms of sinus tenderness or
rhinorrhea to suggest a sinusitis, a clear lung exam, and so
an infectious process did not seem likely, and it was thought
that the patient's cough was most likely secondary to a mild
viral pharyngitis.  He was continued on Cepacol lozenges and
Robitussin p.r.n. for cough.

Hypothyroidism:  The patient's TSH was within normal limits
and he was continued on his Levoxyl.

Cardiovascular:  The patient had no cardiac issues and was
stable throughout his hospital course.  He had a normal 2D
echo performed with normal systolic function.

Mental status:  The patient remained alert and oriented, and
his lactulose was restarted prior to discharge to prevent
hepatic encephalopathy.

Right eye abrasion:  After the TIPS procedure, the patient
had some mild erythema and bruising under his right eye.  The
patient was continued on Lacri-Lube cream, and this right eye
swelling and abrasion resolved prior to discharge.

Access:  The patient had a right IJ line placed in the MICU,
which remained in place until prior to his discharge when it
was pulled.

Code:  The patient was initially DNR/DNI when he was admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**], but after his encephalopathy cleared and after
discussion with his mother, his health care proxy, his code
status was changed to full code, and it was felt that he was
quite lucid, alert, and oriented to make this decision.  As
mentioned, the [**Hospital 225**] health care proxy is his mother.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Gastrointestinal variceal bleed.
Hepatitis B cirrhosis.
Portal hypertension.
Hypothyroidism.
