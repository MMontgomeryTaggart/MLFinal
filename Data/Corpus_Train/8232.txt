**PTCA RESULTS
  LAD

PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography revealed an occluded OM2.
We
planned to treat this with PTCA and stenting. A 6 French XB 3.5
guide
provided good support for the procedure. Heparin and Integrillin
were
used prophylactically. A PT graphix intermediate wire crossed
the lesion
with minimal difficulty. The lesionw as predilated with a 2.0 x
15
voyager balloon at 12 ATM. A 3.0 x 33 mm Cypher DES was deployed
in the
OM2 at 6 ATM. The proximal portion of the stent was postdilated
with a
2.75 x20 mm quantum maverick balloon at 14 and 16 ATM. Final
angiography
revealed no residual stenosis.
At that point the patient complianed of extreme abdominal pain
and right
thigh pain. His blood pressure had dropped to 80 mmHg. Right
fenoral
angiography revealed a R CFA and iliac perforation with
extravasation of
dye. The bladder had a tear drop configuration from compression.
The
 PTA was performed with a 6.0 x 60 mm Admiral
balloon tostabilize the location. An 8 French Balken sheath was
placed
in teh Left femoral artery and a 7.0 x 60 mm Admiral balloon was

inflated in the distal EIA/CFA and the Right CFA balloon was
withdrawn.
Tamponade of the extravasation site was confirmed
angiographically 45
minutes after balloon inflation. The RCFA sheath was removed and
firm
pressure was applied for 45 minutes until hemostasis was
achieved. The
patient left the lab in stable condition with SBP in the 120s on
40
mcg/min of neosynephrine.
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA and
LAD had no
angiographically apparent significant stenoses.  The LCX had a
100%
occluded OM2.  The RCA had no angiographically apparent
flow-limiting
stenoses.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed initially normal systemic
arterial
pressure of 106/69 mm Hg.  There were normal left and right
sided
filling pressures with PCWP mean of 6 mm Hg and RVEDP of 4 mm
Hg.
Cardiac index was not calculated.
3.  During the case, patient became hypotensive with abdominal
and thigh
pain.  The right common femoral artery was noted to have
extravasation
of contrast with a "tear drop" appearance of the bladder,
consistent
with retroperitoneal bleed.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the occluded OM2 with a 3.0 x
33 mm
CYPHER DES. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis and
and no
angiographicallya pparent dissection (see PTCA comments).
5. Successful PTA of the R CFA/EIA with a 6.0 and 7.0 x 60 mm
Admiral
balloon with tamponade of the dye extravasation.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal right and left sided filling pressures.
3. Perforation of iliac-CFA with subsequent retroperitoneal
bleed.
4. Successful stenting of the OM2 with a cypher des.
5. Successful PTA of a perforated R CFA and EIA with a 7.0 mm
balloon.

CT ABD & PELVIS [**2741-12-25**]
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is atelectasis in the lung
bases and no pleural or pericardial effusion. Contrast is seen
in the bladder, kidneys and gallbladder. Otherwise, the liver,
gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, left kidney, and
unopacified stomach, small bowel, and bowel are unremarkable. A
focal region of increased contrast is seen in the posterior
portion of the upper pole of the right kidney. It's calyceal
shape and communication with the collecting system favors a
caliceal diverticula with milk-of-calcium or a naked calix.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the abdominal aorta
and the iliac arteries. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal
adenopathy is evident. There is minimal free fluid in the right
colic gutter. No free intra-abdominal air is present.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A catheter is noted in the right
femoral vein. A small amount of subacute hematoma is seen where
this catheter terminates. A larger extraperitoneal subacute
hematoma is noted in the right pelvis measuring 4.4 x 3.1 x 3.7
cm (2:70, 104B:38). Some amount of hematoma also tracks
superiorly, surrounding the right psoas muscle. Hematoma in the
space of Retzius, anterior to the bladder, with ill-defined
margins. Stranding is also noted in the left inguinal region.
The bladder is decompressed with a Foley catheter in place. The
seminal vesicles and the rectosigmoid colon are unremarkable. No
definite free fluid or pelvic or inguinal adenopathy is present.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the iliac and
femoral arteries. There is asymmetry in the size of the psoas
major muscles, with a more prominent right psoas muscle compared
to the left. While this may represent an intramuscular hematoma,
the fat planes are maintained within the muscle, more consistent
with chronic hypertrophy of the right psoas.
BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar
spine.
IMPRESSION: Extraperitoneal subacute hematoma in the pelvis and
also in the space of Retzius. Right femoral venous catheter in
place.

TTE [**2741-12-25**]:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe focal
hypokinesis of the basal and mid-inferolateral and basal lateral
segments (c/w left circumflex distribution). The remaining
segments are normal/slightly hyperkinetic (LVEF = 45-50%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.


Brief Hospital Course:
# NSTEMI: On admission the patient was taken to the cath lab
where initial angiography revealed an occluded OM2. A cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was deployed in OMS. The pt. then complained of abdominal
pain and right thigh pain and BP dropped to 80mmg Hg. Right
femoral angiography revealed a R CFA and iliac perforation with
extravasation of dye. The bladder had a tear drop configuration
from compression. A balloon was inflated in the distal EIA/CFA
and the Right CFA balloon was withdrawn. Tamponade of the
extravasation site was confirmed angiographically 45 minutes
after balloon inflation. The patient left the lab in stable
condition with SBP in the 120s on 40mcg/min of neosynephrine.
Pressors were weaned quickly post procedure. The patient
remained hemodynamically stable overnight. CT abd and pelvis the
following morning demonstrated an extraperitoneal subacute
hematoma in the pelvis and also in the space of Retzius. The
patient was chest pain free until discharge. He was contined on
aspirin and plavix. Prior to discharge he was started on
atenolol 50mg daily. TTE demonstrated an EF 40-45% and mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction.
.
# Urinary Retention: the patient has a foley placed over a wire
in the cath lab due to urinary retention. He was discharged home
with the foley to place to follow up with urology in seven days.
He also received ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily for three days/

.
The patient was discharged home in good condition.
