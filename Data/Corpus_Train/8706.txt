Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2353**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 year old man with a history of kidney/liver
transplant on immunosupression, DM2, PVD s/p right [**Doctor Last Name **]-AT and
atrial fibrillation s/p DCCV on [**3272-11-10**] who presents with
shortness of breath.

Around [**7-13**] pm on the night prior to admission he developed
insidius shortness of breath associated with chest pressure. He
describes the pressures as constant, [**3273-7-13**] in severity. He had
a hard time laying flat overnight and did not get much sleep. He
also reported fatigue with minimal activity. He denied fever,
chills, palpitations, LE edema, cough or sputum production. He
denied radiation of the pain to his jaw or arm and denied
diaphoresis or lightheadedness. He has had similar symtoms in
the past, most recently in [**May 3272**], when they were associated
with LE edema. His symptoms persisted untill the morning and he
presented to the ED.

Apparently he had been on asymtomatic atrial fibrillation since
[**May 3272**]. An echocardiogram in [**September 3272**] showed mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVEF >55%) with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Also notable were mild diastolic LV dysfunction and mild
moderate mitral regurgitation.  Yesterday, [**3272-11-10**], he underwent
succesfull DCCV. He was feeling well after the procedure. He
reports however, that he missed his dose of lasix for the day.
He had been taking his antihypertensive medications and blood
thiners.

In the ED, he was noted to be hypertensive with BP 180/87,
tachypneic with RR 40 and had a SaO2 of 76% RA. He was placed on
NRB and subsequently on BiPAP. His respirations decreased to 20
and was subsequently placed on NC. His CXR showed worsening of
his pleural effusions. He received nitro ggt, lasix 60 mg IV and
Lovenox (given a subtherapeutic INR). Prior to transfer his
vitals were 98 74 119/66 23 97%4Lt.

On review of systems, he denies ankle edema, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope, any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB - Likely [**2-8**] LV dysfunction in setting of elevated BP,
BNP.  Patient in NSR on initial presentation.  Ruled out for MI.
 Pt's SOB resolved after IV lasix and was placed back on his
home PO lasix dose, on which he continued to diurese well.
.
# AF s/p DCCV - was in NSR throughout hospitalization until AM
of [**11-13**], at which time he converted back to atrial fibrillation
at a rate between 80s-100s.  Currently rate-controlled,
asymptomatic.
- uptitrate home metoprolol dose to 100 mg po bid
- continue warfarin, goal INR 2.0 - 3.0.  Pt was found to be
slightly subtherapeutic on admission, home dose was slightly
uptitrated to 6 mg/d from 5 mg/d.
- patient remained well rate-controlled and asymptomatic after
converting to atrial fibrillation.  It was discussed that he
should follow up closely with his cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
discuss further management options, including repeat attempt at
cardioversion.
.
# HTN - Increased nifedipine, metoprolol doses.
.
# s/p kidney, liver transplant - Found to have significantly
elevated tacrolimus level on admission.  Decreased dose during
admission with plans for repeat check at home this coming
Thursday following discharge.  Nephrology follows patient
closely as an outpatient and will f/u on repeat drug level.
- continue mycophenolate, tacrolimus
- f/u tacro level

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for shortness of breath.  You were found
to have excess fluid in your body which was likely causing your
symptoms.  You received intravenous diuretics which removed the
extra fluid from your body and improved your symptoms.

During your hospitalization, it was discovered that you returned
to a rhythm of atrial fibrillation.  It is currently at a
reasonable rate, controlled with medication.  You should discuss
long-term management of this rhythm with your cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].

The following medications were changed during your
hospitalization:
INCREASED metoprolol from 100 mg daily (succinate) to 100 mg
twice daily (tartrate) to better control heart rate
INCREASED nifedipine to better control blood pressure
INCREASED warfarin to ensure adequate thinning of blood
DECREASED tacrolimus to 2mg twice daily, as you were found to
have a blood level of this medication that was too high during
your hospitalization

Please weigh yourself daily if possible and notify your
physician if you notice a weight change > 3 lbs.  Adhere to a
low-salt, low-cholesterol diet.  You will need your blood
checked this Thursday, [**11-17**], to recheck your tacrolimus level,
as well as to monitor your kidney function and warfarin dosage.

If you experience worsened shortness of breath, chest pain,
fevers, or any other symptoms that worry you, please contact
your PCP or go to the Emergency Department.

Followup Instructions:
Please contact your cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], to schedule an
appointment within the next 1-2 weeks to discuss a plan for
managing your atrial fibrillation, which recurred during this
hospitalization.  You can contact his office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7865**].
