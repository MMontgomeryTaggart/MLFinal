Brief Hospital Course:
57 y/o M with h/o RBBB, DM2, HTN, s/p parathyroidectomy,
presented with radiating substernal CP to L shoulder.
Subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath.

ECG on admission: RBBB, AV dissociation, STE III>II and AVF, STD
V2,V3,I,AVL

Echo ([**3204-2-5**]) [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) 3785**] dilated, LV- wall thickness, cavity,
and systolic fxn normal, trivial TR

Cath:
HD: RA 23/25/21          PA Sat 57%
    RV 44/15/28          CO 3.46
    PA 41/22/31          CI 1.43
    PCW 28
    LV 126/25
LMCA: Nl
LAD: Mild dz prox, tubular 60% lesion in midsegment
LCx: mild diffuse dz
RCA: dominant vessel occluded proximally
Intervention: stenting of RCA proximally w/ 3.5x18mm Cypher
stent x2, residual 0% with TIMI III flow, after mulitple rounds
of vasodilator therapy

ECHO ([**3206-8-18**]):
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Lateral and apical hypokinesis and
inferior akinesis
are present. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately
depressed. EF 35% to 40%
3. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for
review) of [**3204-2-5**], LV function and wall motion abnormalities
are new.

CXR ([**3206-8-18**]):
Possible slight LV decompensation. No other significant
abnormality. Slight thickening of the pleura on the right side
cannot be excluded.

1. CAD. Cath w/ stenting x2 of prox RCA requiring IABP for low
CI. Pos enzymes. cath c/b bradycardia and hypotension secondary
to RV involvement
IPMI -- initially held antihypertensives and gave post cath
hydration with nabicarb.  Once hemodyanically stable restarted
b-b and then added acei as tolerated. Initially kept PAD btw
15-17, pt required preload in setting of right heart ischemia.
Swan was pulled and the pt was weaned off the IABP.
He was continued on ASA, Plavix, Lipitor, integrilin x18hrs, and
heparin while IABP in place and after the integrilin was off.

2. Pump. EF now 35% to 40% with mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Lateral and apical hypokinesis and inferior
akinesis which are new since previous study in '[**03**]. Increased
right sided filling pressures secondary to RV infarct.  Pt is
preload dependent. PAD kept btw 15-19 while pt had a swan. Pt
was carefully diuresed with goal 500 to 1L negative per day.

3. Rhythm. Pt initially presented with high degree AV block with
a rate in the 40's.  Pacing wire placed in cath lab and set at
50.  Block most likely secondary to AV node ischemia from RCA
occlusion. Pt w/o evidence of block in native rhythm since
returned from cath. Temp pacer removed without further
arrythmias.

4. DM. Insulin gtt initially started for elevated BS'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
followed pt and recommended Glargine 60 Units qhs with a regular
insulin sliding scale. Arrangements were made for the pt to f/u
at the [**Last Name (un) **].

5. HTN. BP managed on acei and bb.
