Echo Results
[**2912-7-5**]: Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with near
akinesis of the
distal 2/3rds of the ventricle. The remaining segements are
markedly
hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a large
circumferential
pericardial effusion measuring 2.7cm lateral to the left
ventricle, 1.5cm
inferior to the left ventricle and anterior to the right atrium
with relative
sparing of anterior to the right ventricle (<1cm). The effusion
is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is mild
intermittent RA invagination. There is no evidence of RV
diastolic collapse.
An unusual "mass" is visualized anterior to the right ventricle.
The echo
texture is atypical for hepatic tissue..

[**2912-7-18**]: Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global
left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly
depressed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular
systolic function is normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2912-7-6**], the
LV function has improved and the pericardial effusion is no
longer present.
The mediastinal mass is no longer apparent.,


Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo M w/ h/o HTN, CAD, s/p anterior MI [**2908**] (RCA stent,
unsuccessful LAD intervention); severe systolic and diastolic
dysfunction (EF 35 % [**2-29**]), hyperlipidemia; he had vague CP w/
assoc SOB x days prior to admission. In ed, CXR w/ globular
heart prompted echo that showed large pericardial effusion w/o
echocardiographic tamponade however clinically impending as he
went into rapid AF.  Amiodarone initiated.  Serial echo later
revealed 5cm mediastinal mass, collaborated by CT, and
ultimately biopsied in OR (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 456**], thoracics) and
pericardial effusion drained. sugeons described lesion as
caseating/cheesy hence TB concern and precautions. extubated,
post op w/o complications and diuresed in  CCU for mild decomp
HF. effusion w/u labs included a negative [**Doctor First Name **], RF. HIV negative.
 Preliminary pathology results reported on [**2912-7-8**] (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 464**] revealed highly  atypical squamous epithelial cells
w/o invasion w/ a differential most suggestive for Thymic cyst
(w/ CIS) vs Thymic CA (w/ sqaumous differentiation) vs primary
lung CA (w/ Mets).  Staining for TTF (lung CA) and CD5 (thymic
CA) were non-diagnostic and the decision to biopsy upper lung
nodules that were noted on CT as staging for possible mets.
Respiratory precautions d/c'd as pathology not c/w infection
(AFB stain and flow cytometry negative additionally).
Incidental 5.6cm AAA is evaluated by vasc [**Doctor First Name 465**] consult who felt
no acute surgical repair necessary.
Pt had VATS and wedge resection on [**7-14**] and lung nodules were
sent to pathology.  Two lung lesions were biopsied and third
lesion was too deep to be removed.  Pt while recovering from
surgery had an episode of hypotension with blood pressure drop
to 75/30s.  Pt was thought to be dry and was given aggresive
fluids.  Pt's BP returned to [**Location 230**] and kidney function
improved.  PT fluids stopped and pt started on lasix for net 1L
fluid output.  Pt s/p VATS remianed with a chest tube until
pneumothorax from surgery resolved.  Pt will follow up outpt in
terms of results of biopsy and treatment decisions.

UTI - Pt urine culture came back positive for psuedomonas while
in hospital and pt was started and finished 7 day course of
cipro while in the hospital.  Pt repeat urine cx came back
negative.
