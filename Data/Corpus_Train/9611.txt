function with normal wall motion, no coronary artery disease.

fraction of 62% with hypokinesis in the apex, aortic
insufficiency, 3+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation, and dilated aorta to 5.6 cm.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 66, blood
pressure 115/62, respirations 12, height 6 feet even, weight
180 pounds.  General:  The patient was a tall,
well-nourished, anxious gentleman.  Skin:  Anterior right
tibia with faint rash, otherwise clear.  HEENT:  No
thyromegaly.  He wears [**Location (un) 655**] glasses.  Right ear deformity.
Neck:  Supple.  No jugular venous distention.  No carotid
bruits.  Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  There
was a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur and a faint diastolic
murmur.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused.
Left lower extremity with varicosities.  No venous stasis.
Neurological:  Grossly intact.  Cranial nerves III-XII
grossly intact.  Excellent strength in all four extremities.
Pulses:  Femoral 2+ bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis 2+
bilaterally.  Posterior tibial 2+ bilaterally.  Radial 2+
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 43, white blood cell count 6.5,
platelet count 203,000; PT 12.1, INR 1.0; sodium 140,
potassium 4.2, chloride 105, CO2 21, BUN 18, creatinine 0.7,
glucose 81, LDH 172.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**8-12**], the patient was admitted to
the [**Hospital6 656**] at which time he
underwent an ascending aortic aneurysm repair via Bentall
procedure with #28 gel weave and #25 St. [**Male First Name (un) 657**] aortic valve
replacement.  He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Shortly after arrival in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit, he was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.  He
remained hemodynamically stable overnight with no events and
required no cardioactive intravenous medications.  On the
morning of postoperative day #1, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  His chest tubes were removed, and he
was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit
to ......... for continuing postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.

On postoperative day #2, the patient experienced one episode
of atrial fibrillation for which he was treated with
Lopressor 20 mg IV in 5 mg increments, 40 mEq Potassium, 2 g
of Magnesium Sulfate, and at which time he remained in atrial
fibrillation.  At that time, he was started on Amiodarone
drip.  After a loading dose of Amiodarone, he converted to
normal sinus rhythm.  Over the next several days, the patient
remained hemodynamically stable.  His activity level was
gradually increased to the point that on postoperative day
#4, he was ambulating at a level 3 which was equivalent to
walking 100 feet with minimal assistance.  He was also begun
on anticoagulation for protection of his aortic valve
replacement on postoperative day #2.  The patient received 5
mg of Coumadin on postoperative day #2 and #3, and 10 mg on
postoperative day #4.


At that point, the patient was deemed stable and ready for
transfer to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care
and cardiac rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer, the patient's condition was stable.
