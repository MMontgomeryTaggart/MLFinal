History of Present Illness:
[**Known patient firstname **] is a 48M with a history of diastolic CHF, CAD, morbid
obesity, OSA on CPAP, HTN/HL. He was brought in by EMS with
fever, diarrhea and cough. Patient recently discharged from CCU
admission for CHF exacerbation requiring BiPAP and 30lbs
diuresis, which was complicated by MSSA bacteremia (negative
TEE) on nafcillin infusion through PICC. Three days ago, he
developed low grade feve which increased to Tm 102 today. He's
had diarrhea x 3 days at 6-7 watery and nonbloody bowel
movements daily.  There is no significant abdominal pain, and he
denies any other sick contacts with similar symptoms.  No
myalgias, arthralgias, chest pain, shortness of breath.  He
abides by his 1500cc daily fluid restriction despite his
diarrhea, and continued to take his diuretic and [**Last Name (un) **].  No NSAID
usage.
.
With regards to his breathing, he feels he has worsened since
last discharge, though cannot articulate why.  He has occasional
cough productive of brown phlegm. No PND or orthopnea.  Does not
weigh himself daily and unclear of any significant weight gain
or loss.
Diarrhea x 24 hours. 6-7 episodes today, non-bloody. Mild,
crampy abdominal pain with the diarrhea. No vomiting. Breathing
is at baseline per patient, but has productive cough.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, T 100.9, HR 78, BP 87/34, RR 24,
100% on 12L NRB.  He had a mild leukocytosis to 11.7. Normal
lactate to 1.3. He was treated broadly for antibiotics of
possible bowel source with vancomycin/zosyn/levaquin.  [**Last Name (un) **] noted
with creatinine to 2.8 from baseline 1.0. He was placed on a NRB
for apparent increased work of breathing- sats remained nearly
100%. Prior to transfer, VS  126/66, hr 83, rr 23, sat 99% on
bipap
.
He was twice admitted to [**Hospital1 68**] for CHF exacerbations this past
summer-initially in early [**Month (only) 314**] due to uncontrolled hypertension,
and later in mid-[**Month (only) 328**] for the same.  Of note, he developed
a superficial thrombophlebitis during his last hospitalization
that led to MSSA bacteremia. TTE did not reveal endocarditis. He
was discharged with a PICC on IV nafcillin 2gq4hr to be
completed on [**2842-10-30**].
.
On arrival to the MICU, initial VS were T 102.6, BP126/91, P97,
RR27, Sat99 on6LNC.  He complains of chills.  While breathing
heavily, he feels he is near his baseline.

Physical Exam:
On Admission:
Vitals:T 102.6, BP126/91, P97, RR27, Sat99 on6LNC
General: morbidly obese male, breathing heavily, but in no acute
distress, alert
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, could not assess JVD due to habitus
Lungs: diminished breath sounds bilaterally without crackles or
rhonchi
CV: distant heart sounds, but no MRG appreciated
Abdomen: obese, soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds
present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, could not assess
organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema


Pertinent Results:
CXR:
FINDINGS: The study is markedly limited secondary to massive
body habitus and AP portable technique. The study is nearly
nondiagnostic as there is also respiratory motion. It is
difficult to exclude a mild interstitial edema.  Additionally, a
left lower lung consolidation cannot be excluded. The
mediastinum demonstrates aortic tortuosity similar to prior. The
cardiac silhouette is likely enlarged but stable. Effusions
cannot be excluded.  There is no large pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Nearly nondiagnostic study due to massive body
habitus and AP
portable technique.
.
Unilateral US:
IMPRESSION: No DVT of the left upper extremity.
.
CXR:
As compared to the prior radiographs there is interval
development of left
lower lobe consolidation that potentially might reflect
infectious process.  In addition patient is in mild pulmonary
edema.
For precise characterization of the findings, correlation with
cross-sectional imaging might be considered as well as
re-evaluation of the patient after diuresis.
Right PICC line is in place but its tip cannot be clearly seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
[**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 1023**] is a morbidly obese 48yoM initially presented with
N/V/D and acute renal failure and was admitted to the MICU for
labored breathing whose hospital course was complicated by
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation and massive
fluid diuresis and was found to have aortic valve endocarditis
with worsening aortic regurgitation.
.
# ACTIVE ISSUES:
1) Respiratory Status: Patient was initially admitted with
labored breathing requiring continuous use of BiPAP (settings
IPAP 23, EPAP 18). Given renal failure (see below), diuretics
were initially held. With resolution of diarrhea/fever and
continuous use of BiPAP, patients dyspnea returned to baseline
and patient was called out to the general medicine floors. While
on the floor, patient's renal function continued to worsen and
thus diuretics were continually held. Additionally pt received
several fluid boluses given concern for hypovolemic status.
Cardiology was consulted (given history of heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction) who suggested diuresis despite
renal failure as patient's wt was trending upward. Renal agreed
with plan and pt was started IV diuresis. On [**11-9**], patient
developed acute onset of dyspnea that resulted on hypercarbic
respiratory failure requiring intubation. While in MICU, patient
was aggressively diuresed under concern for flash pulmonary
edema. PE was considered and was empirically started on heparin
however after further evaluation, it was discontinued as patient
improved with diuresis. Pt was on lasix drip initially then
changed to bolus lasix and ultimately to PO torsemide. Pt was
ultimately extubated and continued on diuresis. Pt uses BiPAP at
night at with the following settings: IPAP 22 and EPAP 12. Pt's
wt on discharge was 185kg.
TRANSITION ISSUES:
- Continue torsemide 80mg with goal to be euvolemic to negative
to 500cc. Please titrate torsemide dose to achieve this goal.
- Will need electrolytes to monitor K and Creatinine twice a
week
- Will need to remain on 2L fluid restriction
- Needs agressive physical therapy in order to improve
respiratory status
.
2) Aortic Valve Endocarditis with Worsening Aortic
Regurgitation: Of note patient completed course of MSSA
bacteremia with vancomycin on [**2842-10-30**]. Cardiology suggested a
TEE to better evaluate cardiac function given respiratory
decompenstion, which revealed a new aortic valve vegetation and
worsening aortic regurgitation, which likely caused acute
decompensation. ID was reconsulted who suggested placing patient
on daptomycin. Serial blood cultures were negative although
patient was intermittently febrile during stay. Cardiac surgery
was consulted who recommended finishing 6 week course of
antibiotics as well as cardiac catheterization prior to
evaluation for surgery. PICC line was changed on [**11-15**]. Of note
patient complained of muscle spasms with daptomycin infusion.
After review with pharmacy, this does not appear to be known
drug reaction. Pt willing to cope with spasms as long as
infusion is during the day. Please infusion daptomycin during
the day. Lastly given worsening aortic valve endocarditis,
aggressive afterload reduction was implemented with goal
Systolic BP < 160. Nodal agents were stopped and should be
avoided.
TRANSITION ISSUES:
- Complete 6 (six) week course of daptomycin. Last day will be
on [**2842-12-25**]
- Will need weekly CK, CBC with diff, BUN, Creatinine to be
faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1024**] attn: ID nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] follow up
- Has follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in heart failure clinic - who
will arrange for follow up Echo
- Has follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with cardiac surgery
- Monitor BP and titrate medication as tolerated to keep
systolic BP < 160.
- Needs agressive physical therapy for strength prior to AVR
- Patient will need dental evaluation prior to cardiac surgery
.
3) Acute Renal Failure: Patient initially presented with acute
renal failure. Renal was consulted who felt that presentation
was consistent with acute interstitial nephritis [**2-26**] nafcillin.
Antibiotic was changed to cefazolin however after having a rash,
pt was started on vancomycin. Creatinine continued to raise
despite removal of offending [**Doctor Last Name 176**] which was thought to be [**2-26**]
ongoing diuresis. Renal agreed with diuresis given respiratory
status and felt that creatinine would slowly improve with time.
TRANSITION ISSUES:
- Will need to monitor creatining for worsening kidney function
twice a week
- No need for renal follow up
.
4) Morbid Obesity/Severe physical deconditioning: Patient is
morbidly obese with BMI > 40. Given prolonged hospitalization
and poor physical strength prior to admission, patient needs
agressive physical therapy in order to recover. His medical
issues are now stable and can be adequately cared for by daily
medical evaluation however patietn needs more attention in
physical strengthing training.
TRANSITION ISSUES:
- Aggressive Physical Therapy
.
5) Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Patient severe obstructive sleep
apnea likely [**2-26**] morbid obesity. Pt initially presented with
respiratory complaints (see above) requiring continuous BiPAP.
TRANSITION ISSUES:
- Needs agressive physical therapy in order to lose wt
.
6) Cardiac Dysfunction with Preserved
Function/Hypertension/CAD/Hyperlipidemia: Echo showed preserved
EF. [**Last Name 1025**] Problem#2 for changes and updates. Patient will need
cardiac catheterization prior to surgery.
TRANSITION ISSUES:
- [**Last Name 1025**] problem #2
.
7) FEVERS/NAUSEA/DIARRHEA: Initially presenting symptoms however
resolved with definitive etiology. No further interventions were
necessary.
.
8) Muscle Spasms: Patinet complained of muscle spasms while
receiving daptomycin infusion. Seroquel and flexeril were both
tried with limited response. Pt will to cope with spasms as long
as daptomycin infusion is during day time hours.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital because you were experiencing weakness,
fevers, and diarrhea. When you came to the emergency room, you
appeared to have significant difficulty breathing. You were sent
to the medical ICU, where you were given antibiotics and fluids.
Your kidneys were not functioning well, which was attributed to
a negative reaction to your prior antibiotic, nafcillin, which
you were receiving for your prior blood stream infection. You
ultimately finished a course of antibiotics while on the general
medicine floor.
.
While you were on the medicine floors, you developed signficant
difficulty with your breathing requiring you to come back to the
ICU. A breathing tube was placed to help your breath. You were
started on a medication help remove fluid to help with your
breathing. An ultrasound was completed of your heart which
should that there was an infection on your heart valve that
caused your valve to not work properly. This valve will likely
need to be replaced in the future. You will have to remain on
antibiotics until [**12-25**] in order to appropriately clear
this infection. We had the cardiologist and cardiac surgeons
evaluate for this valve replacement and they will continue to
follow you as outpatient.
.
Because of the long hospital stay, you became deconditioned and
you will need intense physical therapy in order to get better.
.
Please see the attached for your new set of medications.
