History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
72 yo retired nurse developed L sided chest pain about 5 days
ago.  The pain is described as sharp and increases with movement
or respiration and is reproducible by palpation under her L
breast in the anterior axillary line.  Her PCP was concerned for
a pulmonary embolism and checked a D-Dimer which was positive.
She was sent for CTA at [**Hospital 315**] Hospital which was negative for
pulmonary embolism but showed multiple penetrating aortic ulcers
 which were not apparent on CT scan from [**3-1**].  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 68**] for further evaluation.

CIMPRESSION:
1.  Dilatation of the thoracic aorta to 4.7 cm in the descending
aorta and 4.6 cm in the ascending aorta with multiple areas of
ulceration in the arch and descending aorta (including a long
segment portion along the posterior descending thoracic aorta)
with eccentric mural thickening seen in the arch and descending
aorta.

This mural thickening was actually present on the previous scan
with
hyperdense appearance involving both the ascending and
descending thoracic
aortas and thought to perhaps represent intramural hematoma,
which resolved in the ascending aorta and persisted in the
descending aorta with subsequent ulceration in the descending
aorta.

Differential also includes aortitis given the patient's history
of polymyalgia rheumatica with subsequent ulceration, though
that this would persist in one area and resolve in the other
make this less likely.  A third option is clotted dissection,
though again why this should persist in one area and resolve in
another is uncertain.

2.  11-mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe, which is
unchanged from the prior CT in [**Month (only) 1702**].  A followup CT in nine
months' time is recommended unless alternate consideration is
given for other imaging for surgical evaluation.  Alternatively,
comparison with priors can be done to determine stability.

3.  Intrathoracic stomach with rotation suggesting increased
risk of
developing subsequent mesenteroaxial volvulus.

4.  Left ninth posterior rib fracture appears acute. Correlation
with point tenderness is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a reasonably healthy 72-year-old female who
presented to the emergency department on [**2708-6-23**] with a syndrome
of left-sided chest discomfort.  She had undergone serial CAT
scans separated by 3 months which showed significant thoracic
aortic changes.  She has a known 4.7-cm thoracic aneurysm and
over 3 months has developed 3 discrete areas of penetrating
aortic ulcer with intramural hematoma. Despite good blood
pressure control, her pain persisted over night.  Because of the
symptomatic nature of the aneurysm and changes seen on
subsequent CAT scans, she is taken to the operating room
semi-urgently for endovascular repair on [**2708-6-24**].  The procedure
was without complications. She was closely monitored in the ICU
and then transferred to the floor in stable condition where  she
remained hemodynamically stable.  Her diet was gradually
advanced.  She is ambulatory with ad lib. She was discharged to
home on POD # 2 in stable condition.  Follow-up has been
arranged with her PCP/cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for BP and statin
monitoring in one week and  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one month with
surveillance CTA.
